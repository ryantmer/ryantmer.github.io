title: "Very short reviews of movies other people have already seen: Behind Enemy Lines [2001]"
---

Based on a fictional US Navy F-18 navigator who gets shot down over a supposedly DMZ during what is supposedly the Bosnian conflict of the early '90s.

Good enough storyline, somewhat original. Cheesy special effects (it was almost 10 years ago, you know), and too many clichés. Evil Russian sniper anyone?

5.2445/10, for lack of imagination and trying to make me take Owen Wilson seriously.
