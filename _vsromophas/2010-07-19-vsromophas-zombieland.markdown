"Zombieland is an American zombie comedy film directed by Ruben Fleischer from a screenplay written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. The film stars Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin as survivors of a zombie post-apocalypse. Together they take an extended road trip in an attempt to find a sanctuary free from zombies; Columbus (Eisenberg) follows a set of "rules" designed to keep them alive where others have failed; Tallahasee (Harrelson) kills zombies in a variety of creative ways while trying to "enjoy the little things" in a ruined world." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombieland

Feels like a level out of Left 4 Dead in movie form. Almost as fun, too.
