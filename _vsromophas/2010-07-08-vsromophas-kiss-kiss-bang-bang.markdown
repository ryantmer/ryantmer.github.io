title: "Very Short Reviews Of Movies Other People Have Already Seen: Kiss Kiss Bang Bang [2005]"
---

"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a 2005 crime/dark comedy film, which engages many conventions of the classic film noir genre in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. It is based, in part, on the novel Bodies Are Where You Find Them by Brett Halliday. The cast includes Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan. The screenplay was written by Shane Black who also directed the film. It was produced by Joel Silver, and co-produced by Downey's wife Susan Downey (who is credited as Susan Levin). The film's title is a reference to Pauline Kael's 1968 book, which in turn was named after a translation of an Italian poster of a James Bond movie, which she called "perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of the movies."" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_kiss_bang_bang

There is a now a new rule for all future films: Robert Downey, Jr. must be the narrator for all of them. Makes for a dark yet very enjoyable time.
