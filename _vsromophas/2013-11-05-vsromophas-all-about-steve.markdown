title: "Very Short Reviews of Movies Other People Have Already Seen: All About Steve [2009]"

“All About Steve is a 2009 American comedy film directed by Phil Traill.[3] It is distributed by 20th Century Fox. The title is a pun on the 1950 film All About Eve, also made by 20th Century Fox.” – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_About_Steve

Yet another punch-out romantic comedy, this time adding a socially awkward, annoying and creepy female lead to try to distinguish itself from the 9001 other films just like it. Alas, methinks the film doth fail in this regard.

3/10 – 1 point for each enjoyable line in the film.
