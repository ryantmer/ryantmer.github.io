"Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film, directed by and starring Orson Welles. The film is often considered the greatest of all time and is particularly praised for its innovative cinematography, music and narrative structure. Citizen Kane was Welles' first feature film. The film was nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories; it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman Mankiewicz and Welles. It was released by RKO Pictures." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane 

An amazing film about an amazing man. Great writing, great acting, great greatness. 

9.5/10, because (like many films from this era) it is a bit slow at times.
