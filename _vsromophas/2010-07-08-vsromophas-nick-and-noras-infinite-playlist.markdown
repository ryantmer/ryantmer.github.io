"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is a 2008 coming of age teen comedy film directed by Peter Sollett and starring Kat Dennings and Michael Cera. Written by Lorene Scafaria and based on the novel of the same name by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan, the story tells of teenagers Nick (Cera) and Norah (Dennings), who meet when Norah asks Nick to pretend to be her boyfriend for five minutes. Over the course of the night, together they try to find their favorite band's secret show and search for Norah's drunken best friend." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_and_Norah's_Infinite_Playlist

I was not aware that "teenage angst" was a genre of film, but this (along with Juno, et al) may yet prove me wrong. Boring, dumb, and yet another indie-crap soundtrack make for an almost painful movie viewing experience.
