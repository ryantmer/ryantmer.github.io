title: "Very Short Reviews Of Movies Other People Have Already Seen: Fantastic Mr. Fox [2009]"
---

"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a 2009 stop-motion animated film based on the Roald Dahl children's novel of the same name, released in the autumn of 2009. It was produced by Regency Enterprises and Indian Paintbrush, and features the voices of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray. It is the first animated film directed by Wes Anderson, and the first stop-motion animated film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, also the first film by Anderson not to be rated R by the MPAA. Development on the project began in 2004 as collaboration between Anderson and Henry Selick (who worked with Anderson on the 2004 film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) under Revolution Studios. In 2007 Revolution folded, Selick left to direct Coraline, and work on the film moved to 20th Century Fox. Production began in London in 2007." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Mr._Fox_(film)

Somehow, this film's incredible stop-motion animation and quirkiness fully makes up for the fact that the story could have a used a bit more work.
