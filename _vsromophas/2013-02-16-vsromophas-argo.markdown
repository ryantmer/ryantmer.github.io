"Argo is a 2012 American thriller film[3] directed by Ben Affleck; it is a dramatization of and is based on a 2007 article about the "Canadian Caper",[4] in which Tony Mendez, a CIA operative, led the rescue of six U.S. diplomats from Tehran, Iran, during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis." - Wikipedia

Intense. Charged. Veeeeery good. 

9/10, at least.
