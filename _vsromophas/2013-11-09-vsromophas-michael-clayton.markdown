"Michael Clayton is a 2007 American dramatic film written and directed by Tony Gilroy and produced by Sydney Pollack. It stars George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, and Sydney Pollack. It chronicles the attempts of attorney Michael Clayton to cope with a colleague's apparent mental breakdown and the corruption and murderous intrigue of a major client of his law firm being sued in a class action case involving toxic agrochemicals." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Clayton_(film)

I hate to be clichéd, but this is the only film I have ever seen that I can describe as "gripping drama". Damned good, with a hint of oak aftertaste.

8.5262/10 - Tilda Swindon's fake american accent is annoying at times, and the overload of legal and business terms can be somewhat detrimental to the flow of the story in parts.
