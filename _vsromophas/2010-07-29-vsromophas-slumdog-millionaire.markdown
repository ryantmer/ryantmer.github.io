title: "Very Short Reviews Of Movies Other People Have Already Seen: Slumdog Millionaire [2008]"

"Slumdog Millionaire is a 2008 British film directed by Danny Boyle, written by Simon Beaufoy, and co-directed in India by Loveleen Tandan.[2] It is an adaptation of the novel Q &amp; A (2005) by Indian author and diplomat Vikas Swarup. Set and filmed in India, the film tells the story of Jamal Malik, a young man from the Juhu slums of Mumbai who appears on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (Kaun Banega Crorepati in the Hindi version) and exceeds people's expectations, thereby arousing the suspicions of the game show host and of law enforcement officials." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire

A surprisingly good film. Guess there's a reason why it won so many awards. Then again, so did Juno...

9.5/10 - Solid!
