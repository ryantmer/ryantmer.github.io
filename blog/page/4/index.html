<p>It may seem odd that music should make an appearance in my philosophy of life. However, I believe that it has made a huge impact, both in my life and in the world in general. For me, music allows for an escape from everyday life. Perhaps this is because I play it so loud in my room that it blocks out things such as the phone and doorbell. Either way, it is nice that I can come home after a long or boring day at school/work, turn on my stereo, and listen to whatever I feel like listening to. Music has a huge ability to affect mood, and I am no exception to this. If I am feeling tired or bored, a loud, fast song does just the trick to make me feel alive once again. On the other hand, if it is late and I am still wide awake, a ballad from one of my favourite bands will help me relax. Somebody once said that music is what feelings sound like. Perhaps it is because artists put so much feeling into their music that it can have such an effect on my own.</p>

<p>On a more worldly scale, music is the universal language – it brings everybody together, without the need for words or other communication. The core components of music – tempo, key, rhythm – are all universal standards, which makes creating music with people who do not speak your language incredibly easy. Although I have not had such an experience myself, one of my friends went on a world tour with his family a few years ago. He is musically inclined, and so it was only natural that he would find other musically inclined people in the places he visited. One of these places was Tanzania. When he returned, he told me the story of the song he learned in Swahili while he was there. He had no idea what the lyrics meant, but that didn’t matter, as he enjoyed the rhythm and the song was catchy. If I asked him to sing the song today, I have no doubt that he would be able to, even though it was years ago that he learned it.</p>

<p>Money is becoming increasingly more important in the world today. With new technology, millions of dollars can be exchanged in the blink of an eye. New commerce sectors have appeared with the advent of the Internet &ndash; people can make a living without ever lifting a finger. But does all this change money&rsquo;s role in life, and in happiness? For me, no. At this point in my life, money is not the least important thing in my life, but it definitely isn&rsquo;t the most important either.</p>

<p>Some believe that having money or possessions will bring them happiness. This I know not to be true. Although sometimes buying something new and expensive for yourself seems rewarding, the happiness it brings usually wears off very quickly. The time and the effort we put into earning money to be able to buy something are rarely earned back in the hours, maybe only minutes of enjoyment we get from something new. I know this because there have been many things that I have spent hard-earned money on in my life that I wish I had not. A prime example of this is when I bought a computer server from someone who lives down the street. Although it was a few years old, the price at which I was buying it was much less than it was actually worth. Nonetheless, it put me back a few hundred dollars, and now I wish it had not. The problem was not that I had bought something overpriced and useless, but that I had bought something that I didn&rsquo;t need. The server now sits in my room, day after day, doing nothing. I had not fully thought out why I wanted to buy the server- if I had, I would have realized that I had no real need for it and would be a few hundred dollars richer today.</p>

<p>Mentioning that I would have saved money brings me to another philosophy some people have about money: earn it and never spend it. This is very strange to me. If you work hard to earn something, why not use it? Is all the time and effort you spent earning that money not going to waste when you do nothing with it? It is only a hypothesis, but I believe that people who follow this line of thinking believe that by saving their money, they are better prepared for some unforeseen disaster that may befall them. Perhaps they are right in planning ahead in this fashion, but it is reasonable? In my life, I do save some money, but this is for a specific purpose: university. After university, I will probably have something else to save for, like an apartment. However, any money that I believe I have in excess I will probably spend. Although this seems to go against my previous thoughts about spending money, they actually work very well together. For example, I have now been working for two years, and I have accumulated a decent amount of savings. I will not need all of this to pay for tuition, so I decided that I could spend some on buying a new computer. I spent many months thinking about this purchase before buying it to ensure that I was not wasting my money, and when I finally did, I felt that I had bought something that will serve me day after day for several years. In spending my money wisely, I prevented being frivolous, but I also managed to enjoy myself.</p>

<p>To me, freedom in all its forms, is very important. Freedom of choice, freedom of speech, freedom of creativity – all of these I value dearly. Although I am generally a rule-abiding individual, I am liable to break the rules once my freedom is infringed upon. For example, if someone were to tell me that I am no longer allowed to be out past dark, I would be very upset. Although I do not generally stay out very late anyway, it is the idea that someone is trying to take away my right to do so that would irritate me.</p>

<p>I also believe that freedom of thought and speech enables us to better help society by saying and doing what we want, within reasonable boundaries. A famous example of somebody who used their freedom to help the betterment of society is Gandhi. Going against all odds, it was his freedom of thought that compelled him to free India from British rule. A much less famous example, yet possibly just as influential in the modern world, is Free/Open Source Software (FOSS). Although many people are not familiar with this concept, FOSS is software wherein the code used to make it is freely available and can be downloaded, edited and shared by anybody, all for free. What does this have to do with freedom, you ask? Quite simply, FOSS gives software authors the tools and resources they need to better their skills, and to help society. For example, FOSS was used for the One Laptop Per Child project, an attempt to bring technology to some of the poorest regions of the globe. Without the freedom that is FOSS, the software engineers that were part of the project would have been held back by legal matters, corporate greed, and capitalist competition.</p>

<p>An example in my own life of what freedom means to me, aside from the fact that I am avid supporter of FOSS, is that I will almost always say what I think. Without freedom of speech, people are not allowed to criticize their government, poke fun at the media, or be honest about what they think about a matter of importance. Although I do not openly insult people, I am honest, and will say what I honestly think when asked. If I were not able to do this, or if I had to fear for my life every time I made fun of Harper, I believe that my life would far too restrictive for me to handle.</p>

<p>Friendship is very important in a person&rsquo;s life, no matter who they are. It is practically a human necessity to have someone&rsquo;s shoulder to cry on, or to talk about absolutely inane things with. To me, friends are of great importance, even though there are aspects of friendship that one must be careful of.</p>

<p>Since I was young, I have always had a smaller group of friends. I believe this is because I would rather have a few good friends than many acquaintances. Maybe I&rsquo;m just cheap and don&rsquo;t want to buy lots of birthday and Christmas presents. Either way, I have always believed that friends are like so many things in life: quality is more important than quantity. Sometimes, I just need someone to talk to, and I am much more comfortable talking to somebody I know well. Sure, having a lot of close friends with whom you can talk would be nice, but friendship does require a fair amount of effort, and that probably would not be easy.</p>

<p>Friends are very important in my life, but there are certain aspects of friendship which can be somewhat dangerous. When you get to know someone really well, you tend to share rather personal information with them. This is why I prefer to have a smaller circle of friends: the fewer people I tell sensitive things to, the less chance there is of it becoming public. Although real friends would never reveal secrets about you, some will turn against you. This sort of action, whether done through malice, revenge, or envy, is one of the dangers of having friends. I have never had this problem. Perhaps this is because I am a very mellow person, and so are many of my friends. Perhaps it is because I rarely talk to any but my closest about sensitive things. Perhaps it is a combination of both. Either way, I have never broken up with a friend- for example, I have been friends with Johnathan since grade 2. Friendship is a very important thing to have in life, and even though it has its risks, just like everything else, it is one of the surest recipies for happiness.</p>

<p>When defining our philosophy on love, it is important to first define our philosophy as to what love is. To me, love is a deep respect and understanding between two individuals. It goes deeper than a friendship, deeper than idolization, deeper than lust. I do not believe that love conquers all odds, nor do I believe that you can only love once. I don&rsquo;t even believe that it is only possible to love only one person at a time – in fact, I love many people in my life (assuming I use my own definition of love).</p>

<p>For some people, love seems to be their goal in life. If they do not find a partner, get married and have a family, they will consider themselves unfulfilled. Although these things are nice, I do not believe that they are necessary. In fact, I am closer to believing the opposite, especially when it comes to marriage. I believe that marriage is an old and outdated ritual, and there really is no reason for it anymore. Hundreds of years ago, it may have made sense, but it is now obsolete. Two loving individuals should be able to be together without a ring and piece of paper to legally bind them. In fact, I see marriage as a weakness in a relationship- almost as if those involved feel they need a contract to prove that they do love each other.</p>

<p>Some say that love is extremely rare, or that it only happens once in a lifetime. I hope this isn&rsquo;t true, otherwise the rest of my life could prove to be loveless. Do I believe that I was in love? Yes. But again, this is according to my own definition of love. If someone else had analyzed the relationship I once had with somebody, they probably would have made a very different conclusion.</p>

<p>Although I believe you can love more than one person at a time, I would not describe myself as polyamourous. I believe that love is much like friendship, in that it is possible for it to extend to several people in your life simultaneously.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This was written as an assignment for my grade 12 religion class, which I recently re-discovered. Interesting for me to read, to see how it aligns with that which I believe now, but likely boring as hell for others. Enjoy at your own risk.</em></p>

<p>For me, my beliefs are based on logic and facts. For this reason, I do not follow any established religion, nor do I believe in any sort of omnipresent being. I believe that the universe and our world are controlled and exist by the laws of physics and human decision. However, even though I believe this, I have no objection to what others choose to believe, so long as they do not try to convert me to their method of thinking.</p>

<p>Since I was young, I have always been curious, and have always sought answers. Anytime something puzzled me, I sought to know the truth about it. In light of this, I never completely warmed up to the idea of a god. I found that a being watching over us and controlling the universe was completely absurd, and I therefore discounted it as a myth. Since then, I have not changed my views, although I have become more understanding of why people choose to be religious. Some seek safety – they believe that the afterlife will welcome them, no matter what they do in life. Some seek answers to the questions that science has not yet been able to solve.</p>

<p>Others, though, are essentially forced into religion by the teachings of their parents, teachers, and peers. This irritates me. Much like advertisers, religions tend to go after youth, as they are the easiest to influence. Many people, when asked why they became religious, will simply say that it is because their whole family is religious. Is this really a reason? If my parents love to drive motorcycles, does this mean I should too? In my mind, no. In my mind, religion should not even be introduced to children until they are at least 12. By this time, they are generally mature enough to decide for themselves whether they will choose to follow a religion or not. Although this will likely never happen, I would be curious to see how the number of people who are religious would change.</p>

<p>Another problem that I have with religion is the tension it creates. The Crusades, the Salem witch trials, suicide bombers. All of these are caused by misunderstandings and intolerance between religions. Even though most religions teach non-violence, there are those who misinterpret these teachings and cause suffering. Although I do believe that religion helps some people become more upstanding members of society, it has the opposite effect on others. I do not believe that godlessness is the solution to suffering, but it may help some people become more tolerant of others.</p>

<p>Whether we know it or not, everyone has their own philosophy of life. What we do, think and say is guided by our views on certain matters of importance. These views are all part of our philosophy. Sometimes, these views come from a classroom, sometimes a church, but more often than not, these views come from our own experiences. When we are young, we do not have a clearly defined philosophy. We are mostly told what to do and when to do it. As we age, though, we experience more and more situations where there isn&rsquo;t a teacher or parent around to tell us what to do. These situations, where we must decide things for ourselves, and ultimately hold our own fate in our own hands, are what help people more clearly define their philosophy of life. For many people, these situations begin to happen a lot more in high school. Greater liberty and more responsibilities, both at school and at home, result in youth having to make more of their own decisions than ever before. Because of this, what better time is there to organise our thoughts on specific issues into a well-organised paper?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>ffmpeg (<a href="http://ffmpeg.org/">http://ffmpeg.org/</a>) is, without a doubt, the best video conversion tool available. Got something preferred? You&rsquo;re either wrong, or (more likely), the tool you&rsquo;re using actually uses ffmpeg in the background. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not the most well-documented tool available, so some tasks (like overlaying two videos so they play side-by-side) can be somewhat difficult. Through pure coincidence and nothing else, this is how you do said overlay. In this example, two videos will be scaled down to 640x360, then overlaid such that they appear side-by-side.
1. ffmpeg.exe -i Left_side_video.avi -vf scale=640:360,pad=1280:360:0:0:black -r 30 Left_side_video_small.avi
2. ffmpeg.exe -i Right_side_video.avi -vf scale=640:360 -r 30 Right_side_video_small.avi
3. ffmpeg.exe -i Left_side_video_small.avi -vf &ldquo;movie=Right_side_video_small.avi [mv]; [in][mv] overlay=640:0&rdquo; -r 30 Video_Comparison.avi</p>

<ul>
<li>The -i argument specifies the input video.</li>
<li>The -r argument specifies frame rate. For this to work properly, both videos must be exactly the same framerate.</li>
<li>The -vf arguments are the video filter arguments. There are tonnes of these (check the docs) that can do a tonne of things. Very handy.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every day on my way to work, I bike past an elementary school. When I&rsquo;m running a bit late (which happens all too often), I bike past right before the bell rings. I hear laughing and yelling, the usual jovial sounds of youth and whatnot. I see kids running around, having fun, hitting each other with baseball bats with nails in them (it&rsquo;s a tough hood). Basically, I see and hear the very definition of being carefree. I know this question has become cliché to the point that saying it is cliché is clichéd, but seriously – what happened to us? When did the world&rsquo;s problems become our problems?</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t isolate when it was. Sometime in high school? Maybe sometime after, perhaps before. I don&rsquo;t recall. At some point, the biggest problem in our lives went from eating sand, to what that cute girl thinks of us, to applying to university, to jobs, and finally to the spread of malaria in Africa. But hold on a minute – when we moved onto these big, wide-spreading, world-changing problems, did we even bother to solve the ones we had in the first place? Did we get the sand out of our teeth? Did we find out if she likes us? Did we make a final decision on whether that&rsquo;s actually what we want a degree in? Did we get the cushy job we&rsquo;d always dreamed of? I&rsquo;m going to venture way out on a limb here and answer all of those at once: Nope. A full and resounding negative, captain. So why not? If we moved onto other tasks at work before finishing the previous ones, we&rsquo;d soon be out of a job. That, or we&rsquo;d be swamped with unfinished business that would weigh us down. So why do we think we can do it in our personal lives?</p>

<p>On a small scale, I see many people taking on the problems of friends and lovers as their own. Their friends are having a bad day, so they are too. Their friends are stressed, so they are too. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong – it&rsquo;s good to care. That&rsquo;s what friendship and love are about. But don&rsquo;t ever, ever, ever take other people&rsquo;s problems on without first solving your own. Taking on problems when you are not completely stable and secure in yourself is a bit like loading cargo onto a sinking ship. Sure, it&rsquo;ll stay dry for a while, but when that ship finally sinks, it&rsquo;s all going under. For those not so metaphorically inclined, think of the number of therapists that off themselves. It&rsquo;s hard to take on other people&rsquo;s problems if you&rsquo;re not prepared for it. So, if not for yourself, do your friends a favour, and don&rsquo;t support them with weak arms, bound to fail.</p>

<p>On a larger scale, I see this in entire societies. We donate money to charities to help with who knows what in who knows where. Are we blind to the problems we have right at home, or are we just stupid? Again, I&rsquo;m not saying caring is bad. I&rsquo;m just pointing out the irony in thinking the lives of those in another country or on another continent are miserable, when there are thousands right here who have also had their fair share of misfortune. Do I think that we are more important that people in other countries? Of course not. But again – how are you supposed to drive trucks across a bridge that&rsquo;s only half built?</p>

<p>This may seem like a very selfish idea. Don&rsquo;t be fooled – it is. It absolutely is. It is a selfish need to feel better about yourself, so you can feel more secure, so you can go about your life being much happier. But if anybody asks, just say you&rsquo;re doing it to better help people. Just to seem like a bit less of a dick.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Easy Rider is a 1969 American road movie written by Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Terry Southern, produced by Fonda and directed by Hopper. It tells the story of two bikers (played by Fonda and Hopper) who travel through the American Southwest and South with the aim of achieving freedom. The success of Easy Rider helped spark the New Hollywood phase of filmmaking during the late sixties. The film was added to the Library of Congress National Registry in 1998.</p>

<p>A landmark counterculture film, and a &ldquo;touchstone for a generation&rdquo; that &ldquo;captured the national imagination,&#8221;Easy Rider explores the societal landscape, issues, and tensions in the United States during the 1960s, such as the rise and fall of the hippie movement, drug use, and communal lifestyle. Easy Rider is famous for its use of real drugs in its portrayal of marijuana and other substances.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Rider">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Rider</a></p>

<p>Not only is this a landmark counterculture film that defined a generation and simultaneously redefined Hollywood, it&rsquo;s also unbelievably boring.</p>

<p>3/10, for making elevator music seem exciting.</p>
