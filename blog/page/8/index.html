It was released in the United States on February 6, 2009, and in Canada on April 3, 2009.&rdquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboys_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboys_</a>(2009_film)</p>

<p>Not funny to non-fanboys, and so full of dumb stereotypes that it&rsquo;s probably on the verge of offensive towards actual fanboys.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Animal Crackers is a 1930 American comedy film, in which mayhem and zaniness ensue when a valuable painting goes missing during a party in honor of famed African explorer Captain Spaulding. The film was both a critical and commercial success upon initial release, and remains one of the Marx Brothers&#8217; most beloved and often-quoted movies. Filming was done at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens, and was the last film the brothers would make in New York.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crackers_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crackers_</a>(film)</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain, this leaves me speechless!&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;The Men Who Stare at Goats is a 2009 slapstick comedy war film directed by Grant Heslov and written by Peter Straughan and released in theaters on November 6, 2009. It is based on the book of the same title by author Jon Ronson, an account of the investigation by Ronson and John Sergeant[3] into attempts by US military forces to use psychic powers.&rdquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats_</a>(film)</p>

<p>If you liked Burn After Reading, you&rsquo;ll like this. However, if you don&rsquo;t want to wait 80 minutes for an ending scene that you may or may not find hilarious, this does not an entertaining film make.</p>

<p>6.66/10 &ndash; a slapstick comedy war film with only slapstick and war for the most part.</p>
