  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;The Men Who Stare at Goats is a 2009 slapstick comedy war film directed by Grant Heslov and written by Peter Straughan and released in theaters on November 6, 2009. It is based on the book of the same title by author Jon Ronson, an account of the investigation by Ronson and John Sergeant[3] into attempts by US military forces to use psychic powers.&rdquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats_</a>(film)</p>

<p>If you liked Burn After Reading, you&rsquo;ll like this. However, if you don&rsquo;t want to wait 80 minutes for an ending scene that you may or may not find hilarious, this does not an entertaining film make.</p>

<p>6.66/10 &ndash; a slapstick comedy war film with only slapstick and war for the most part.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Funny People is a 2009 American comedy-drama film written, co-produced, and directed by Judd Apatow, and starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Aubrey Plaza and Aziz Ansari as stand-up comedians. The film was released on 31 July 2009 in North America, and on 28 August 2009 in the United Kingdom. Funny People implements more dramatic elements than seen in Apatow&rsquo;s previous films. The film was co-produced by Apatow Productions and Mr. Madison 23 Productions, a subsidiary of Sandler&rsquo;s company Happy Madison. Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures co-financed the film and Universal also served as a worldwide distributor.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_people">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_people</a></p>

<p>Funny People is not funny (Adam Sandler is in it, so this should be obvious). However, taken as a drama, it&rsquo;s actually not a half bad film, and it is interesting to see many of the actors in much more serious roles than they usually are in.</p>

<p>6/10 &ndash; remove 1 for the misleading title, 1 for the bad ending, 1 for making it waaaaay to long, and 1 because I&rsquo;m mean.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Liar Liar is a 1997 American comedy film written by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, directed by Tom Shadyac and starring Jim Carrey. Carrey was nominated for a Golden Globe Award (1997) for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture &ndash; Comedy/Musical. The film is the second of three collaborations between Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac, the first being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and the third being Bruce Almighty. It is also the second of three collaborations between Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, the first being The Little Rascals and the third being Heartbreakers. It was shot entirely in California.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_Liar">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_Liar</a></p>

<p>An amusing premise (a lawyer who can&rsquo;t lie for an entire day) make for a film almost as made for Jim Carrey as The Mask was.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Slumdog Millionaire is a 2008 British film directed by Danny Boyle, written by Simon Beaufoy, and co-directed in India by Loveleen Tandan.[2] It is an adaptation of the novel Q &amp; A (2005) by Indian author and diplomat Vikas Swarup. Set and filmed in India, the film tells the story of Jamal Malik, a young man from the Juhu slums of Mumbai who appears on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (Kaun Banega Crorepati in the Hindi version) and exceeds people&rsquo;s expectations, thereby arousing the suspicions of the game show host and of law enforcement officials.&rdquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire</a></p>

<p>A surprisingly good film. Guess there&rsquo;s a reason why it won so many awards. Then again, so did Juno&hellip;</p>

<p>Hard to describe. Harder to review. It&rsquo;s free under Creative Commons, just download it from the Pirate Bay. The best anti-establishment film since &ldquo;The Corporation&rdquo;. Making DOW Chemical lose 2 billion dollars is funny.</p>

Together they take an extended road trip in an attempt to find a sanctuary free from zombies; Columbus (Eisenberg) follows a set of &#8220;rules&rdquo; designed to keep them alive where others have failed; Tallahasee (Harrelson) kills zombies in a variety of creative ways while trying to &ldquo;enjoy the little things&rdquo; in a ruined world.&ldquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombieland">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombieland</a></p>

<p>Feels like a level out of Left 4 Dead in movie form. Almost as fun, too.</p>
