<p>A shocking and powerful yet somewhat dramatized look into drug addiction from four distinct points of view. Certainly not a happy movie, this would do a better job of preventing drug use than most other methods, I would imagine…</p>

<p>8/10, for making me feel all unhappy inside.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film, directed by and starring Orson Welles. The film is often considered the greatest of all time and is particularly praised for its innovative cinematography, music and narrative structure. Citizen Kane was Welles&#8217; first feature film. The film was nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories; it won an Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman Mankiewicz and Welles. It was released by RKO Pictures.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane</a></p>

<p>An amazing film about an amazing man. Great writing, great acting, great greatness.</p>

<p>9.5/10, because (like many films from this era) it is a bit slow at times.</p>

<p>Yet another punch-out romantic comedy, this time adding a socially awkward, annoying and creepy female lead to try to distinguish itself from the 9001 other films just like it. Alas, methinks the film doth fail in this regard.</p>

<p>3/10 – 1 point for each enjoyable line in the film.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The film stars Tim Robbins as Andrew &#8220;Andy&rdquo; Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd &ldquo;Red&rdquo; Redding. The film portrays Andy, who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison, a fictional penitentiary in Maine, and his friendship with Red, a fellow inmate. Despite a lukewarm box office reception that was barely enough to cover its budget, the film received favorable reviews from critics, multiple award nominations, and has since enjoyed a remarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. This revival is reflected in its high placement on various lists of great movies.&ldquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption</a></p>

<p>A new entrant in my personal top 10. Intrigue, drama, humour, and one twisted bastard. Redemption is a dish best served by Morgan Freeman.</p>

<p>9/10 &ndash; because the non-word &ldquo;funner&rdquo; is used once, and the fact that Andy&rsquo;s hair somehow stays the same for 10 years in prison bothered me&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is what I would thoroughly classify under, &ldquo;rare, but irksome&rdquo; problems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a Steinberg CI1 mixer that I use as an input for my guitar, and have my KRK studio monitors plugged into for output. It&rsquo;s plugged into my computer as well, so I can either run the guitar to the monitors, or my PC&rsquo;s sound (or both). The mixer uses either line-level or +48V phantom power for the inputs. Which is great for a guitar, or for a professional microphone, but the microphones in PC headsets (mostly condenser mics, which are fairly cheap) run at the +5V supplied by a computer&rsquo;s soundcard. Which is&hellip; awkward, and since I just bought a shiny new Razer Blackshark headset, I figured I should find a way to plug the PC mic into the mixer, for convenience and whatnot.</p>

<p>So, I found a way. It takes the mic signal from the 3.5mm TRS connector from the headset, amplifies it, and outputs to a &frac14;&#8221; TS connector (although it could just as easily be a 3.5mm TS jack, if that&rsquo;s what you required). Pretty simple, parts list as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>3.5mm female TRS connector jack</li>
<li>&frac14;&#8221; male TS connector (with some cable attached, I just used part of an old guitar cable)</li>
<li>10uF capacitor (I&rsquo;d say 16V+, the one I&rsquo;ve used is 100V, but that&rsquo;s overkill, just what I had)</li>
<li>2.2kOhm resistor</li>
<li>9V battery connector</li>
</ul>


<p>The circuit diagram is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://mahler.ca/notablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/PC-Headset-to-Mixer-amp.jpg" alt="Circuit diagram for amp" /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s uhh&hellip; That&rsquo;s pretty much it. I put it into a fancy little project box, to make it fancy, as below. Aside from that, just connect the 9V battery whenever you need to use the mic, plug your headset into the 3.5mm end, then plug the &frac14;&#8221; side into the mixer, and you should be good to go!</p>

<p>Fancy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Possible things, then, will be all those things that are not impossible things &ndash; that is, all those things that are either contingent or necessary. If there are no necessary things then all possible things will be contingent and all contingent things will be possible. If there is a necessary thing, however, then there will be a possible thing which is not contingent.&rdquo; &ndash; Philosophy: The Quest For Truth (Pojman, Vaughn)</p>

<p>This is a quote from a textbook for a first year philosophy course.</p>

<p>I have long maintained that the idea that some academic programs are harder than others is preposterous. I&rsquo;ve experienced this from both ends &ndash; people telling me that I &ldquo;must be really smart to be in computer engineering&rdquo;, since there&rsquo;s &ldquo;no way they could do that!&rdquo;, as well as those informing me that psychology is &ldquo;waaaaaay harder&rdquo; than computer engineering, because it requires &ldquo;hours of reading every day, and you&rsquo;ve got to write a thesis and if you don&rsquo;t get published your entire degree is a waste!&rdquo; Both of these statements I find to be a bit&hellip; well, rather silly.</p>

<p>For example: I find the textbook paragraph above extremely difficult to parse and understand, whereas a language-brain-type would have no issue doing so; that said, I am likely able to parse and understand concepts of analog signals better than they would. It&rsquo;s much less a matter of the content, and more a matter of the reader or learner. Different people have difficulty with different things, simple as that.</p>

<p>While anecdotal evidence is a logical fallacy (see <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal">https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal</a>), and I am in no way basing my conclusions off just this, my own progress and marks (most notably in my university career, although a similar analysis could be done for high school if I had the marks accessible) are a good example of how wrong this claim is. Last term &ndash; my second half of 3rd year computer engineering (honours) at the University of Waterloo &ndash; I took Psych 101 as an elective. You know, THE Psych 101 course. The one that seemingly everybody who has ever been to university has taken &ndash; and passed without any effort. Well, I got a lower mark in THE Psych 101 course than I did in my 3rd-year computer networks course, despite Psych 101 being generally recognized as a bird course for first years. In fact, I received a lower mark in Psych 101 than I received in my 3rd-year engineering economics course as well. Speaking of that, I also took Econ 102 (macroeconomics, another one of those everybody-takes-it first year courses) in the same term, and received nearly the same mark in it as the aforementioned 3rd year engineering economics course &ndash; a course that should, by it&rsquo;s description at least, be much more difficult. So what gives?</p>

<p>Now, you might think this breaks down to amount of effort put in. Undoubtedly, I spent more time on my engineering courses than I did my Psych 101 and Econ 102 electives. But, quite frankly, that wasn&rsquo;t the root cause of the lower marks. The entire term, I knew that it wasn&rsquo;t time, or studying that would enable me to get 100% in these supposedly simple, throwaway courses. I knew what would, though &ndash; nothing. Well, nothing short of a brain transplant. Thing is, I don&rsquo;t have the brain required for social sciences, or economics, or (apparently) philosophy. These are topics that require huge amounts of memorization, which I am simply unable to do (unless you&rsquo;re talking Arrested Development quotes, that&rsquo;s an exception). They also are topics where there is, at times, very little connectedness &ndash; although this may only be from my perspective, really. I find the topics we learn about in our computer engineering courses to be very interrelated, both within topics in a course as well as within courses (even spanning multiple years), whereas I don&rsquo;t see this same sort of network forming with other subjects. Adding to my perhaps skewed perception is the professors teaching these courses. My engineering economics course and Econ 102 had similar content, but the engineering one was framed in such a way that it had more of that connectedness, and I was therefore able to do just fine in it. On the other hand, Econ 102 was presented more as a loosely-connected list of concepts, without much &ldquo;glue&rdquo; tying them together in real-world application, making it much harder for me to really understand what was going on.</p>

<p>So, am I insane? Or do I have a point here? I don&rsquo;t actually know to be honest. Thing is, at this point, having been through most of a university degree, there&rsquo;s really no way for me to compare. If I were to pursue a degree in psychology after graduating, it would be an unfair comparison. I already have experience with the university education system, allowing me to effectively game the system at times, much like students do in high school. (Other students, I mean. Not me. I was a workaholic for those four years. Totally.)</p>

<p>In conclusion (he wrote, feeling a bit like a high school student trapped in an essay), it seems to me that while not all degrees are created equal, not all people are created equal either, and we therefore cannot judge the relative merit of degrees based on perceived difficulty. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, so we tend to take pity on ourselves and think that we&rsquo;re in the roughest spot, and that everybody else has it easy. Well guess what? They don&rsquo;t. Stop saying they do. Putting them down to make yourself feel better kinda makes you a jerk, and if there&rsquo;s one thing I know, there isn&rsquo;t a course that is designed for the jerk-brained.</p>

<p>(In preparation for philosophy essay due next week, I am adding a few sentences down here to bring the word count up to 1000 words. It&rsquo;s amazing that I can just braindump this much without even trying, whereas said philosophy essay is taking far, far more effort. Shoot, 989 at that last sentence. So, now I&rsquo;m at 1000. Exactly, actually.)</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay folks, it&rsquo;s time for me to let you in on a little secret, one that I&rsquo;ve learned from living in the north for most of my life &ndash; &ldquo;snow tires&rdquo; and &ldquo;winter tires&rdquo; are NOT the same thing, and confusing the two is, to put it lightly, not a great idea.</p>

<p>Snow tires are barely available anymore &ndash; see <a href="http://www.wheels.ca/how-do-winter-tires-differ-from-snow-tires/%C2%A0for">http://www.wheels.ca/how-do-winter-tires-differ-from-snow-tires/%C2%A0for</a> more information &ndash; and are meant for deep snow driving. The equivalent of a deep-paddle snowmobile track. Know what they&rsquo;re terrible for? Pavement. While surface area doesn&rsquo;t increase friction (actually reduces it), it&rsquo;s important to have a larger contact patch on slippery surfaces, so that there is a greater chance of some part of the contact patch grips.</p>

<p>Alright, so who gives a damn? They don&rsquo;t make snow tires anymore, why bother with the distinction? Well, it seems that people are stuck on the term &ldquo;snow tires&rdquo;, and therefore think that they should only remove their &ldquo;all&rdquo;-season tires when the snow flies. (&ldquo;All-season&rdquo; is not a name that makes sense here &ndash; not for shoes, and not for tires.) This is, quite simply, wrong. Want to know when you should remove the all-seasons? When it&rsquo;s below 7 degrees. Yep. Seven degrees Celsius. Above zero. (see <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/car-tips/why-you-still-need-winter-tires-on-dry-pavement/article4180768/,">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/car-tips/why-you-still-need-winter-tires-on-dry-pavement/article4180768/,</a> <a href="http://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/3701/,">http://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/3701/,</a> and <a href="http://www.wheels.ca/why-winter-tires-there-are-many-reasons/">http://www.wheels.ca/why-winter-tires-there-are-many-reasons/</a>) This is because the composition of all-season tires and winter tires is very different. When it goes below 7, the ability of all-seasons to flex is drastically reduced, meaning they can&rsquo;t properly grip pavement. Winter tires, on the other hand, are made of softer compounds, and so are more able to do so. This makes an immense difference, one that only 37% of Canadians are aware of. (Apparently, <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/manitobans-dont-roll-on-winter-tires-181961121.html">only 37% of Canadians own winter tires</a>.) As someone who has driven with and without winter tires on snow, I can confirm that the difference is rather noticeable.</p>

<p>Oh, and for the record &ndash; the last time it was consistently above 7 degrees in Waterloo was October 27th. So, 6 weeks ago is when everybody should have switched to the winter tires, and yet most cars I see are still rocking the crappy all-seasons.</p>

<p>I will state that I personally don&rsquo;t own a car, and so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to buy them. Yes, they are expensive. But consider that since you&rsquo;re switching to your winter tires for 4 months of the year, your all-seasons will last 33% longer, and not running into poles or other cars is always a good way to save money, too!</p>

<p>So please, for your safety, for the safety of other drivers, and for the safety of utility poles all over &ndash; get some <em>winter</em> tires, and use them!</p>
