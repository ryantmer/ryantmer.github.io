<p>Great music, great acting, and great writing. Why does nobody make movies like this anymore? SAD PANDA.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Funny People is a 2009 American comedy-drama film written, co-produced, and directed by Judd Apatow, and starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Aubrey Plaza and Aziz Ansari as stand-up comedians. The film was released on 31 July 2009 in North America, and on 28 August 2009 in the United Kingdom. Funny People implements more dramatic elements than seen in Apatow&rsquo;s previous films. The film was co-produced by Apatow Productions and Mr. Madison 23 Productions, a subsidiary of Sandler&rsquo;s company Happy Madison. Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures co-financed the film and Universal also served as a worldwide distributor.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_people">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_people</a></p>

<p>Funny People is not funny (Adam Sandler is in it, so this should be obvious). However, taken as a drama, it&rsquo;s actually not a half bad film, and it is interesting to see many of the actors in much more serious roles than they usually are in.</p>

<p>6/10 &ndash; remove 1 for the misleading title, 1 for the bad ending, 1 for making it waaaaay to long, and 1 because I&rsquo;m mean.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Liar Liar is a 1997 American comedy film written by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, directed by Tom Shadyac and starring Jim Carrey. Carrey was nominated for a Golden Globe Award (1997) for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture &ndash; Comedy/Musical. The film is the second of three collaborations between Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac, the first being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and the third being Bruce Almighty. It is also the second of three collaborations between Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, the first being The Little Rascals and the third being Heartbreakers. It was shot entirely in California.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_Liar">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_Liar</a></p>

<p>An amusing premise (a lawyer who can&rsquo;t lie for an entire day) make for a film almost as made for Jim Carrey as The Mask was.</p>

Set and filmed in India, the film tells the story of Jamal Malik, a young man from the Juhu slums of Mumbai who appears on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (Kaun Banega Crorepati in the Hindi version) and exceeds people&rsquo;s expectations, thereby arousing the suspicions of the game show host and of law enforcement officials.&rdquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slumdog_Millionaire</a></p>

<p>A surprisingly good film. Guess there&rsquo;s a reason why it won so many awards. Then again, so did Juno&hellip;</p>

<p>9.5/10 &ndash; Solid!</p>

<p>Hard to describe. Harder to review. It&rsquo;s free under Creative Commons, just download it from the Pirate Bay. The best anti-establishment film since &ldquo;The Corporation&rdquo;. Making DOW Chemical lose 2 billion dollars is funny.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for another dumb movie with cheap laughs, you&rsquo;ve found one.</p>

<p>4/10, mainly due to the redeeming feature that is Jane Lynch.</p>

Over the course of the night, together they try to find their favorite band&rsquo;s secret show and search for Norah&rsquo;s drunken best friend.&rdquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_and_Norah">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_and_Norah</a>&rsquo;s_Infinite_Playlist</p>

<p>I was not aware that &ldquo;teenage angst&rdquo; was a genre of film, but this (along with Juno, et al) may yet prove me wrong. Boring, dumb, and yet another indie-crap soundtrack make for an almost painful movie viewing experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a 2005 crime/dark comedy film, which engages many conventions of the classic film noir genre in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. It is based, in part, on the novel Bodies Are Where You Find Them by Brett Halliday. The cast includes Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan. The screenplay was written by Shane Black who also directed the film. It was produced by Joel Silver, and co-produced by Downey&rsquo;s wife Susan Downey (who is credited as Susan Levin). The film&rsquo;s title is a reference to Pauline Kael&rsquo;s 1968 book, which in turn was named after a translation of an Italian poster of a James Bond movie, which she called &#8220;perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of the movies.&rdquo;&ldquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_kiss_bang_bang">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_kiss_bang_bang</a></p>

<p>There is a now a new rule for all future films: Robert Downey, Jr. must be the narrator for all of them. Makes for a dark yet very enjoyable time.</p>
