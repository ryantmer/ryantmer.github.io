  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay folks, it&rsquo;s time for me to let you in on a little secret, one that I&rsquo;ve learned from living in the north for most of my life &ndash; &ldquo;snow tires&rdquo; and &ldquo;winter tires&rdquo; are NOT the same thing, and confusing the two is, to put it lightly, not a great idea.</p>

<p>Snow tires are barely available anymore &ndash; see <a href="http://www.wheels.ca/how-do-winter-tires-differ-from-snow-tires/%C2%A0for">http://www.wheels.ca/how-do-winter-tires-differ-from-snow-tires/%C2%A0for</a> more information &ndash; and are meant for deep snow driving. The equivalent of a deep-paddle snowmobile track. Know what they&rsquo;re terrible for? Pavement. While surface area doesn&rsquo;t increase friction (actually reduces it), it&rsquo;s important to have a larger contact patch on slippery surfaces, so that there is a greater chance of some part of the contact patch grips.</p>

<p>Alright, so who gives a damn? They don&rsquo;t make snow tires anymore, why bother with the distinction? Well, it seems that people are stuck on the term &ldquo;snow tires&rdquo;, and therefore think that they should only remove their &ldquo;all&rdquo;-season tires when the snow flies. (&ldquo;All-season&rdquo; is not a name that makes sense here &ndash; not for shoes, and not for tires.) This is, quite simply, wrong. Want to know when you should remove the all-seasons? When it&rsquo;s below 7 degrees. Yep. Seven degrees Celsius. Above zero. (see <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/car-tips/why-you-still-need-winter-tires-on-dry-pavement/article4180768/,">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/car-tips/why-you-still-need-winter-tires-on-dry-pavement/article4180768/,</a> <a href="http://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/3701/,">http://www.guideautoweb.com/en/articles/3701/,</a> and <a href="http://www.wheels.ca/why-winter-tires-there-are-many-reasons/">http://www.wheels.ca/why-winter-tires-there-are-many-reasons/</a>) This is because the composition of all-season tires and winter tires is very different. When it goes below 7, the ability of all-seasons to flex is drastically reduced, meaning they can&rsquo;t properly grip pavement. Winter tires, on the other hand, are made of softer compounds, and so are more able to do so. This makes an immense difference, one that only 37% of Canadians are aware of. (Apparently, <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/manitobans-dont-roll-on-winter-tires-181961121.html">only 37% of Canadians own winter tires</a>.) As someone who has driven with and without winter tires on snow, I can confirm that the difference is rather noticeable.</p>

<p>Oh, and for the record &ndash; the last time it was consistently above 7 degrees in Waterloo was October 27th. So, 6 weeks ago is when everybody should have switched to the winter tires, and yet most cars I see are still rocking the crappy all-seasons.</p>

<p>I will state that I personally don&rsquo;t own a car, and so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to buy them. Yes, they are expensive. But consider that since you&rsquo;re switching to your winter tires for 4 months of the year, your all-seasons will last 33% longer, and not running into poles or other cars is always a good way to save money, too!</p>

<p>So please, for your safety, for the safety of other drivers, and for the safety of utility poles all over &ndash; get some <em>winter</em> tires, and use them!</p>

<p>Some people live for the present, others in the past. I prefer to live for the future. This is because I believe that the future holds huge amount of promise, both for humanity and for myself. In fact, I often cannot wait to see what amazing things will happen in the future.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I do not believe that someday in the future, all of the world&rsquo;s problems will be solved. However, my outlook is nonetheless rather positive. Technological and medical advancements, along with more widespread education, are slowly but surely raising the standard of living throughout the world. Sometimes it may not seem this way, with millions dying every year of starvation, but if we look back in history, there is definitely an upward trend in people&rsquo;s happiness with their lives. For example, every time a new cure is found and put into practice, hundreds, thousands, maybe even millions of lives are saved. However, we must remember that these things can take time, and the one thing that the future has plenty of, is time.</p>

<p>Another aspect regarding the future that people have a philosophy about is whether or not to plan for it. Some people choose to organize every moment of their lives, from dawn until dusk. Others never plan a thing, and prefer to live on the wild side. I find myself on both ends of the spectrum, depending on what it is we are talking about. For example, I think it is important to plan education. As I apply to universities for next year, I realize how important it is to stay organized, and plan ahead so that I do not miss deadlines. Conversely, there are things that I prefer to be somewhat unorganized. In the summer of 2006, my family went on a canoeing trip in Quetico Park, in Ontario. Although we knew where we going, and approximately when, most of the trip was largely unplanned. In the end, it ended up being one of the most exciting vacations I have ever been on. Living without planning, along with the fact that we were somewhat “in the wild” added a sort of excitement to the whole thing, that people who meticulously plan every detail will unfortunately never experience.</p>

<p>Nobody can honestly say that they do not want to be happy in their lives. Some will claim otherwise, but this is generally just a call for attention. Because this is the case, it seems only fitting to have a section on what some see as the goal of life, happiness, in my philosophy of life.</p>

<p>I will start by answering the simplest question about happiness, yet possibly the most difficult to answer: what is happiness? This is a very important question to ask, as it is the answer to this that can very well decide whether an individual will ever be truly happy with their lives. For some, happiness is not easily attained. Instead, it requires a very specific set of circumstances – perhaps a family, perhaps money, perhaps love – before they can be happy. For others, like myself, happiness comes more from the simple fact that I know that I am alive and well. Maybe this seems quaint and cliche, but it is the honest truth. Because I do not believe in the afterlife, what I do in this life is very important, and because of this, what I do in this life makes me happy. According to some studies, involvement in a religion actually tends to make people happier. I personally feel that although this is possible, it may have something to do with their beliefs. If someone is not happy, perhaps they see this is a sign that they are unhappy with what their god has given them in life, which would be considered blasphemous.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe the situation in which I would be most happy. I am fairly certain that I would not be rich and famous, not be around computers, nor would I be on an island in the middle of nowhere, alone with my thoughts. I think that because I am so happy with my day to day life, it is actually very hard to describe a happier situation. On the other hand, perhaps I am afraid that if I do think of a happier place, I will spend all my time dreaming about it, and get nothing done until I find myself in that place!</p>

<p>Most people my age hate waking up early every morning to go to school and spend seven hours learning about things that they don’t think they will ever need to know. Excluding the waking up early part, I am of an opposite opinion. I find education very important in my life. In fact, I believe that one of my favourite things to do is learn.</p>

<p>While learning seems like a rather ridiculous hobby, I very much enjoy it. There are an infinite number of things to know about our universe, and although I will never know everything, I certainly enjoy trying. I&rsquo;m not really sure where my curiosity originates from, but I generally don&rsquo;t waste my time questioning things like this. Instead, I spend my time learning about the world around me. I believe that education is important to further the human race in every aspect. This is why I donate to charities that help further (mainly children&rsquo;s&#8217;) education in third world countries. Although I do not have the resources to help others learn in remote parts of the world, I enjoy helping them get access to the learning materials we have here in Canada. Interestingly, one aspect about school that I do not enjoy is the times when we aren&rsquo;t learning something new, i.e. tests and lunch hour. It is for this reason that I come home at lunch: I sit down at a computer and read about all the new things happening in the world today. It may seem like an introverted and ridiculous thing to do, but I would much rather learn something new than socialize meaninglessly with people.</p>

<p>It may seem odd that music should make an appearance in my philosophy of life. However, I believe that it has made a huge impact, both in my life and in the world in general. For me, music allows for an escape from everyday life. Perhaps this is because I play it so loud in my room that it blocks out things such as the phone and doorbell. Either way, it is nice that I can come home after a long or boring day at school/work, turn on my stereo, and listen to whatever I feel like listening to. Music has a huge ability to affect mood, and I am no exception to this. If I am feeling tired or bored, a loud, fast song does just the trick to make me feel alive once again. On the other hand, if it is late and I am still wide awake, a ballad from one of my favourite bands will help me relax. Somebody once said that music is what feelings sound like. Perhaps it is because artists put so much feeling into their music that it can have such an effect on my own.</p>

<p>On a more worldly scale, music is the universal language – it brings everybody together, without the need for words or other communication. The core components of music – tempo, key, rhythm – are all universal standards, which makes creating music with people who do not speak your language incredibly easy. Although I have not had such an experience myself, one of my friends went on a world tour with his family a few years ago. He is musically inclined, and so it was only natural that he would find other musically inclined people in the places he visited. One of these places was Tanzania. When he returned, he told me the story of the song he learned in Swahili while he was there. He had no idea what the lyrics meant, but that didn’t matter, as he enjoyed the rhythm and the song was catchy. If I asked him to sing the song today, I have no doubt that he would be able to, even though it was years ago that he learned it.</p>
