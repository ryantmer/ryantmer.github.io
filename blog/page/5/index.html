  <div class="entry-content"><p>Completely revamped the photos section of this site. If you find any anomalies, let me know. Some stuff is still in progress.</p>

<p>For the boring code people: Wrote it all from scratch, tried both a PHP/JS and a PHP-only version, and although the PHP/JS one was slightly faster, the PHP-only one was a lot cleaner. It&rsquo;s all done automated-ed-ly &ndash; I just stick folders of full-size, unedited photos in the right place, and bam shazam &ndash; a Perl script does the resizing, everything else is generated when you load the PHP page.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sometimes, life doesn&rsquo;t go the way you want it to.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you look outside, and all you see are gray skies.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you want time to skip a few days, or months, or years.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you want time to stop.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you have to climb walls built out of the bodies of your enemies.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you have to build walls out of the bodies of your friends.</p>

<p>Sometimes, your head longs strongest, but your heart longs longest.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you have to change direction in life.</p>

<p>Sometimes, all you do is turn back.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in longing for the mediocre, you turn away the best.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you have to make decisions that you&rsquo;re afraid of.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you can&rsquo;t help but think &ldquo;what if?&rdquo;, only to realize &ldquo;what if&rdquo; never would have happened anyway.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you look for love in all the places you know, but it turns out that you only know the wrong places.</p>

<p>But sometimes&hellip;</p>

<p>Sometimes, the road straightens out.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the skies clear and the sun rises on a new horizon.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you just have to enjoy the good moments, and remember the bad ones.</p>

<p>Sometimes, all barriers ahead of you crumble, leaving a clear path in their midst.</p>

<p>Sometimes, your heart and your head agree.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when you head back, you head home.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the hardest decisions make themselves, and the hardest question to answer is, &ldquo;Shaken or stirred?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes, the mediocre turns out to be best, and the best turns out to be less.</p>

<p>Sometimes, &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t nearly as good as what is.</p>

<p>Sometimes, love finds you &ndash; huddled up in the corner of a cold room inhabited by the lost and the lonely.</p>

<p>And sometimes, you get bored late at night and write some artsy shit on the internet that&rsquo;s all deep and whatnot.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;The Italian Job is a 1969 British caper film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin, produced by Michael Deeley and directed by Peter Collinson. Subsequent television showings and releases on video have established it as an institution in the United Kingdom.&rdquo; -Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_italian_job">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_italian_job</a></p>

<p>While I won&rsquo;t deny that this film has legacy (cars falling down cliffs sound familiar?), the characters have about as much depth as a kiddie pool, and the overall cheesiness is to cheesy to be funny.</p>

<p>4/10. Meh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;The Bourne films are a series of assassin films based on the character Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia, created by author Robert Ludlum. All three of Ludlum&rsquo;s novels were adapted for the screen, featuring Matt Damon as the titular character in each. Doug Liman directed The Bourne Identity (2002), Paul Greengrass directed The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), and Tony Gilroy co-wrote each film. The series is noted for its realism, in contrast to the growing use of CGI in the action genre.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_</a>(film_series)</p>

<p>What can only be described as the world&rsquo;s longest chase scene does manage to remain thrilling and action-packed throughout all three films, but it is nonetheless three films which probably would have been just as good packed into one film&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&ldquo;The Fast and the Furious is a 2001 street racing action film starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. Directed by Rob Cohen, The Fast and the Furious was the first mainstream film to feature the Asian automotive import scene in North America. It is the first film in The Fast and the Furious film series. The concept was loosely inspired by a Vibe magazine article about street racing in New York City. It bears no relation to the earlier racing film of the same name. The plotline is also loosely similar to Point Break&rdquo; -Â <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious_</a>(2001_film)</p>

<p>A quote to sum up this film &ndash; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got nitrous in his blood, and a gas tank for a brain&rdquo;. So, lots of cars, and lots of dumb.</p>
