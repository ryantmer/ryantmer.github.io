    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a 2005 crime/dark comedy film, which engages many conventions of the classic film noir genre in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. It is based, in part, on the novel Bodies Are Where You Find Them by Brett Halliday. The cast includes Robert Downey, Jr., Val Kilmer and Michelle Monaghan. The screenplay was written by Shane Black who also directed the film. It was produced by Joel Silver, and co-produced by Downey&rsquo;s wife Susan Downey (who is credited as Susan Levin). The film&rsquo;s title is a reference to Pauline Kael&rsquo;s 1968 book, which in turn was named after a translation of an Italian poster of a James Bond movie, which she called "perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of the movies.&rdquo;&ldquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_kiss_bang_bang">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_kiss_bang_bang</a></p>

<p>There is a now a new rule for all future films: Robert Downey, Jr. must be the narrator for all of them. Makes for a dark yet very enjoyable time.</p>

<p>8/10</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[Wikipedia is down at the moment, so I can&rsquo;t plagiarize a description from it]</p>

<p>Animated, but don&rsquo;t mistake this for a kid&rsquo;s movie. A new take on a post-apocalyptic world makes for a fun 90 minutes.</p>

<p>9/10 (Just because deus ex machina is used a wee bit too often, mostly courtesy of 7.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Platoon is a 1986 war film written and directed by Oliver Stone and starring Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, and Charlie Sheen. It is the first of Stone&rsquo;s Vietnam War trilogy, followed by 1989&rsquo;s Born on the Fourth of July and 1993&rsquo;s Heaven &amp; Earth. Stone wrote the story based upon his experiences as a U.S. infantryman in Vietnam, as a counter to the vision of the war portrayed in John Wayne&rsquo;s The Green Berets.[1] The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1986. In 2007, the American Film Institute placed Platoon at #83 in their "AFI&rsquo;s 100 Years&hellip; 100 Movies&rdquo; poll. British television channel Channel 4 voted Platoon as the 6th greatest war film ever made, behind Full Metal Jacket and ahead of A Bridge Too Far.&ldquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon_</a>(film)</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why people think it&rsquo;s good &ndash; because it is. Does an excellent job of portraying the descent into madness that many involved in the Vietnam War experienced in the face of a faceless enemy.</p>

<p>9.5/10 &ndash; Good. Damned good.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Armageddon is a 1998 American disaster/science fiction-action film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and released on Disney&rsquo;s Touchstone Pictures label. The movie tells of a group of blue-collar deep-core drillers sent by NASA to stop an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. It featured an all-star cast including Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Peter Stormare, Michael Clarke Duncan and Steve Buscemi. It is now released on Blu-ray.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon_</a>(1998_film)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a Michael Bay film. Explosions and clichés. What else do you want? A painfully long two and a half hours&hellip;</p>

<p>5/10 &ndash; because fancy explosions count for something, I guess&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The Fifth Element is a 1997 science fiction film directed by Luc Besson, starring Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, and Chris Tucker. Mostly set during the twenty-third century, the film&rsquo;s central plot involves the survival of humanity, which becomes the duty of a taxicab driver (and former special forces major) named Korben Dallas (Willis) when a young woman (Jovovich) falls into his taxicab. Upon learning of her significance, Korben must join efforts with the girl and a priest (Holm) to recover four mystical stones which are key to defending Earth from an impending attack of pure evil and destruction.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Element">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Element</a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just&hellip; not sure. This film is weird, and frankly quite boring. About 2/3 of the way through, I was still waiting for the story to start.</p>

<p>4/10. So boring that I can&rsquo;t even think of a reason why I&rsquo;m giving it 4/10.</p>
