After researching a bunch of different to-do list sites, services, and apps in the past, I settled on using [Toodledo](http://www.toodledo.com) as a tool to get my life organized. While I find the service to be excellent, the BlackBerry 10 apps that are available weren't to my liking, so I made my own - [Sync for Toodledo](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/59942234). It's a pretty basic app which allows viewing, adding, and editing tasks. This is intended as a quick-and-easy way to add stuff to Toodledo, so only implements the basic features (including notes and folders).

If you're interested, check it out in [BlackBerry App World](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/59942234), or grab the source from my Github.
