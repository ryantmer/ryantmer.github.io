title: "New photos section"
---

Completely revamped the photos section of this site. If you find any anomalies, let me know. Some stuff is still in progress.

For the boring code people: Wrote it all from scratch, tried both a PHP/JS and a PHP-only version, and although the PHP/JS one was slightly faster, the PHP-only one was a lot cleaner. It's all done automated-ed-ly - I just stick folders of full-size, unedited photos in the right place, and bam shazam - a Perl script does the resizing, everything else is generated when you load the PHP page.
