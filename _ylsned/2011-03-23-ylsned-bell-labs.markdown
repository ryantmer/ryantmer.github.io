title: "You learn something new every day - Bell Labs"
---

Bell Labs is (at least partially) responsible for the transistor, UNIX, C, C++, discovering the wave nature of matter, the Hall effect, speech synthesis, the photovoltaic cell (solar cell), the 32-bit processor, fiber optics, wireless networking, the 56k modem (for dial-up), Plan 9 and the laser, among many other accomplishments. Not bad for something based out of New Jersey.
