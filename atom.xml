    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Fantastic Mr. Fox is a 2009 stop-motion animated film based on the Roald Dahl children&rsquo;s novel of the same name, released in the autumn of 2009. It was produced by Regency Enterprises and Indian Paintbrush, and features the voices of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray. It is the first animated film directed by Wes Anderson, and the first stop-motion animated film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, also the first film by Anderson not to be rated R by the MPAA. Development on the project began in 2004 as collaboration between Anderson and Henry Selick (who worked with Anderson on the 2004 film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) under Revolution Studios. In 2007 Revolution folded, Selick left to direct Coraline, and work on the film moved to 20th Century Fox. Production began in London in 2007.&rdquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Mr._Fox_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Mr._Fox_</a>(film)</p>

<p>Somehow, this film&rsquo;s incredible stop-motion animation and quirkiness fully makes up for the fact that the story could have a used a bit more work.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;Funny People is a 2009 American comedy-drama film written, co-produced, and directed by Judd Apatow, and starring Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Aubrey Plaza and Aziz Ansari as stand-up comedians. The film was released on 31 July 2009 in North America, and on 28 August 2009 in the United Kingdom. Funny People implements more dramatic elements than seen in Apatow&rsquo;s previous films. The film was co-produced by Apatow Productions and Mr. Madison 23 Productions, a subsidiary of Sandler&rsquo;s company Happy Madison. Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures co-financed the film and Universal also served as a worldwide distributor.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_people">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_people</a></p>

<p>Funny People is not funny (Adam Sandler is in it, so this should be obvious). However, taken as a drama, it&rsquo;s actually not a half bad film, and it is interesting to see many of the actors in much more serious roles than they usually are in.</p>

<p>6/10 &ndash; remove 1 for the misleading title, 1 for the bad ending, 1 for making it waaaaay to long, and 1 because I&rsquo;m mean.</p>

The film stars Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin as survivors of a zombie post-apocalypse. Together they take an extended road trip in an attempt to find a sanctuary free from zombies; Columbus (Eisenberg) follows a set of &#8220;rules&rdquo; designed to keep them alive where others have failed; Tallahasee (Harrelson) kills zombies in a variety of creative ways while trying to &ldquo;enjoy the little things&rdquo; in a ruined world.&ldquo; - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombieland">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombieland</a></p>
