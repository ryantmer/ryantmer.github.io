	<p>ffmpeg (http://ffmpeg.org/) is, without a doubt, the best video conversion tool available. Got something preferred? You&#8217;re either wrong, or (more likely), the tool you&#8217;re using actually uses ffmpeg in the background. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not the most well-documented tool available, so some tasks (like overlaying two videos so they play side-by-side) can be somewhat difficult. Through pure coincidence and nothing else, this is how you do said overlay. In this example, two videos will be scaled down to 640x360, then overlaid such that they appear side-by-side.
1. ffmpeg.exe -i Left_side_video.avi -vf scale=640:360,pad=1280:360:0:0:black -r 30 Left_side_video_small.avi
2. ffmpeg.exe -i Right_side_video.avi -vf scale=640:360 -r 30 Right_side_video_small.avi
3. ffmpeg.exe -i Left_side_video_small.avi -vf &#8220;movie=Right_side_video_small.avi [mv]; [in][mv] overlay=640:0&#8221; -r 30 Video_Comparison.avi</p>

	<p>Every day on my way to work, I bike past an elementary school. When I’m running a bit late (which happens all too often), I bike past right before the bell rings. I hear laughing and yelling, the usual jovial sounds of youth and whatnot. I see kids running around, having fun, hitting each other with baseball bats with nails in them (it’s a tough hood). Basically, I see and hear the very definition of being carefree. I know this question has become cliché to the point that saying it is cliché is clichéd, but seriously – what happened to us? When did the world’s problems become our problems?</p>

It tells the story of two bikers (played by Fonda and Hopper) who travel through the American Southwest and South with the aim of achieving freedom.

	<p>&#8220;The Bourne films are a series of assassin films based on the character Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia, created by author Robert Ludlum. All three of Ludlum&#8217;s novels were adapted for the screen, featuring Matt Damon as the titular character in each. Doug Liman directed The Bourne Identity (2002), Paul Greengrass directed The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), and Tony Gilroy co-wrote each film. The series is noted for its realism, in contrast to the growing use of CGI in the action genre.&#8221; - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_(film_series)</p>

Directed by Rob Cohen, The Fast and the Furious was the first mainstream film to feature the Asian automotive import scene in North America. It is the first film in The Fast and the Furious film series. The concept was loosely inspired by a Vibe magazine article about street racing in New York City. It bears no relation to the earlier racing film of the same name. The plotline is also loosely similar to Point Break” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious_(2001_film)</p>

	<p>Having spent the last two days at a NAPEG (http://www.napeg.nt.ca/) conference, I&#8217;ve heard some fairly inspiring, informative and motivating speeches and presentations. However, one particular sentence spoken by one presenter really got me thinking. Oddly, it had nothing to do with her presentation, and in fact was, in context, a largely meaningless phrase - &#8220;Otherwise it&#8217;ll just be normal, and normal is depressing.&#8221; Yes, this is one of those weird things that gets me thinking. In order to do a traditional thought analysis at this point, it would probably be advisable to get out a dictionary and define &#8220;normal&#8221;, as well as explore what depression is. However, I&#8217;m not a linguist, nor am I a doctor, so going into such activites would be largely pointless, since I aim to thoroughly ignore both definitions and research. (Facts? Pfft, you can use facts to prove anything!)</p>

It was produced by Regency Enterprises and Indian Paintbrush, and features the voices of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray. It is the first animated film directed by Wes Anderson, and the first stop-motion animated film to be distributed by 20th Century Fox, also the first film by Anderson not to be rated R by the MPAA. Development on the project began in 2004 as collaboration between Anderson and Henry Selick (who worked with Anderson on the 2004 film The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou) under Revolution Studios. In 2007 Revolution folded, Selick left to direct Coraline, and work on the film moved to 20th Century Fox. Production began in London in 2007.” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Mr.<em>Fox</em>(film)</p>

        <a class="post-link" href="/news/2010/04/03/bad-drivers/">Bad Drivers</a>
	<p>In a sorely misguided attempt to make the world a better place, I&#8217;ve added a bad drivers database. Here, you can add info about any sort of terrible instances of driving you happen upon (in Yellowknife, I observe these types of events several times a day). In theory, people seeing a description of their car and how much of a moron they are online will help them become a better driver. In reality, this is just another way for me (and others) to take out aggression through the wonderful anonymity that the internet provides. Everybody wins!</p>
