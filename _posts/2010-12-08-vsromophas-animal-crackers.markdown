"Animal Crackers is a 1930 American comedy film, in which mayhem and zaniness ensue when a valuable painting goes missing during a party in honor of famed African explorer Captain Spaulding. The film was both a critical and commercial success upon initial release, and remains one of the Marx Brothers' most beloved and often-quoted movies. Filming was done at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens, and was the last film the brothers would make in New York." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crackers_(film)

"Captain, this leaves me speechless!"

"Well, see that you remain that way."

7/10 - if you're looking for clean, silly wordplay humour, look here. If you aren't, go away.
