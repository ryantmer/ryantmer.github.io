"(500) Days of Summer is a 2009 romantic-drama-comedy film. It was written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, directed by Marc Webb, produced by Mark Waters, and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. The story is presented in a nonlinear narrative structure and depicts a memory-driven look at a failed romance." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(500)_Days_of_Summer

Not a movie that I would usually like, but I was somehow smiling the whole way through. Then again, that could just be Zooey Deschanel. One of those films that bills itself as "quirky", this is one of the few that does it relatively well. Not sure that the comedy tag fits this film - although amusing, I'm not sure that I ever actually laughed. Well, except at the impromptu musical number.

8.5/10 - would be 7.5, but Zooey Deschanel's cuteness gives an extra point.
