"The Mummy is a 1999 American historical adventure film written and directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the title role as the reanimated mummy. It is a loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name which starred Boris Karloff in the title role. Originally intended to be part of a low-budget horror series, the movie was eventually turned into a blockbuster adventure film with mild horror themes." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mummy_(1999_film)

As close to Indiana Jones as you can get if Harrison Ford bothers you on a deep, subconscious level.

8/10 - Solid, although not quite as good as Indy's flicks.
