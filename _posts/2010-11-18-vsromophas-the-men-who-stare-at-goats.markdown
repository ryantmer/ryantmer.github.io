"The Men Who Stare at Goats is a 2009 slapstick comedy war film directed by Grant Heslov and written by Peter Straughan and released in theaters on November 6, 2009. It is based on the book of the same title by author Jon Ronson, an account of the investigation by Ronson and John Sergeant[3] into attempts by US military forces to use psychic powers." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats_(film)

If you liked Burn After Reading, you'll like this. However, if you don't want to wait 80 minutes for an ending scene that you may or may not find hilarious, this does not an entertaining film make.

6.66/10 - a slapstick comedy war film with only slapstick and war for the most part.
