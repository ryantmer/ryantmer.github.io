In a sorely misguided attempt to make the world a better place, I've added a bad drivers database. Here, you can add info about any sort of terrible instances of driving you happen upon (in Yellowknife, I observe these types of events several times a day). In theory, people seeing a description of their car and how much of a moron they are online will help them become a better driver. In reality, this is just another way for me (and others) to take out aggression through the wonderful anonymity that the internet provides. Everybody wins!

I, for one, will be keeping a notepad and pen in my car from now on...
