"The Italian Job is a 1969 British caper film, written by Troy Kennedy Martin, produced by Michael Deeley and directed by Peter Collinson. Subsequent television showings and releases on video have established it as an institution in the United Kingdom." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_italian_job

While I won't deny that this film has legacy (cars falling down cliffs sound familiar?), the characters have about as much depth as a kiddie pool, and the overall cheesiness is to cheesy to be funny.

4/10. Meh.
