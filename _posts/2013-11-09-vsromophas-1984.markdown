"Nineteen Eighty-Four (sometimes 1984) is a British film, released in 1984, based upon George Orwell's novel of the same name, following the life of Winston Smith in Oceania, a country run by a totalitarian government. The film was directed by Michael Radford and stars John Hurt, Richard Burton (in his last film role) and Suzanna Hamilton." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_(1984_film)

Thought-provoking but at times very hard to follow (I blame 80's recording technology). Whether you like it or not, this one is going (or already has gone) down in history. Not sure if the book is better, as I have not read it.

8.11(repeating decimal)/10.
