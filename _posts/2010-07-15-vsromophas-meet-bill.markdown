"The story revoles around Bill, A banker who is disatified with his life, job, marriage, hair and weight. Along with his father-in-law and brother-in-law, who are his bosses at work, Bill enters into system at a local school were he gets a child to "mentor" Bill ends up getting "The Kid". When returning home Bill discovers his wife having a suspicious phonecall and considers she might be having an affair, so before going on a hunting trip with his in-laws and the kid Bill sets up a camera in his bedroom and catches his wife having an affair with Chip Johnson, a local news anchor." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meet_Bill

Odd. Perhaps too odd. A mostly unpleasant viewing experience.
