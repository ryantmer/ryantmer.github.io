"The Yes Men Fix the World (2009) is a documentary film about the culture jamming exploits of The Yes Men. The film premiered in New York City and Los Angeles on October 23, 2009 and in other U.S. cities beginning on October 30. The film is being sued for impersonating the United States Chamber of Commerce and is thus being distributed via peer-to-peer sites such as The Pirate Bay." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yes_Men_Fix_the_World

Hard to describe. Harder to review. It's free under Creative Commons, just download it from the Pirate Bay. The best anti-establishment film since "The Corporation". Making DOW Chemical lose 2 billion dollars is funny.
