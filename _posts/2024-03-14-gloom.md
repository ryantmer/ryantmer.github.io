I made a thing. It's at [mahler.ca/gloom-tracker](https://mahler.ca/gloom-tracker).

Interesting note, it's quite easy to deploy GitHub repos to GitHub Pages sites using a [pretty simple workflow](https://github.com/ryantmer/gloom-tracker/blob/main/.github/workflows/static.yml).

Anyway, back to not posting anything here for a few more years.
