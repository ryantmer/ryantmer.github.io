"The Fifth Element is a 1997 science fiction film directed by Luc Besson, starring Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman, Milla Jovovich, Ian Holm, and Chris Tucker. Mostly set during the twenty-third century, the film's central plot involves the survival of humanity, which becomes the duty of a taxicab driver (and former special forces major) named Korben Dallas (Willis) when a young woman (Jovovich) falls into his taxicab. Upon learning of her significance, Korben must join efforts with the girl and a priest (Holm) to recover four mystical stones which are key to defending Earth from an impending attack of pure evil and destruction." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifth_Element

I'm just... not sure. This film is weird, and frankly quite boring. About 2/3 of the way through, I was still waiting for the story to start.

4/10. So boring that I can't even think of a reason why I'm giving it 4/10.
