"Fanboys is a 2009 comedy film directed by Kyle Newman and starring Sam Huntington, Chris Marquette, Dan Fogler, Jay Baruchel and Kristen Bell. It was released in the United States on February 6, 2009, and in Canada on April 3, 2009." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboys_(2009_film)

Not funny to non-fanboys, and so full of dumb stereotypes that it's probably on the verge of offensive towards actual fanboys.
