"The Good, the Bad, the Weird is a 2008 South Korean Western film, directed by Kim Ji-woon, starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Byung-hun, and Jung Woo-sung. It was inspired by Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad,_the_Weird

That awkward moment when South Koreans can make a better Western than Americans. Awkward. But also really good.

9/10, a good movie to watch while on ex-vacation.
