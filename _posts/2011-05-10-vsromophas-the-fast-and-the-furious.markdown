"The Fast and the Furious is a 2001 street racing action film starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster. Directed by Rob Cohen, The Fast and the Furious was the first mainstream film to feature the Asian automotive import scene in North America. It is the first film in The Fast and the Furious film series. The concept was loosely inspired by a Vibe magazine article about street racing in New York City. It bears no relation to the earlier racing film of the same name. The plotline is also loosely similar to Point Break" -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious_(2001_film)

A quote to sum up this film - "He's got nitrous in his blood, and a gas tank for a brain". So, lots of cars, and lots of dumb.

4/10
