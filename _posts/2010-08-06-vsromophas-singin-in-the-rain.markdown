"Singin' in the Rain is a 1952 American comedy musical film starring Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Connor, and Jean Hagen and directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, with Kelly also providing the choreography. It offers a comic depiction of Hollywood, and its transition from silent films to "talkies."" -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin_in_the_rain

Great music, great acting, and great writing. Why does nobody make movies like this anymore? SAD PANDA.
