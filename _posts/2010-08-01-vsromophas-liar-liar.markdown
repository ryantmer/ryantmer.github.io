title: "Very Short Reviews Of Movies Other People Have Already Seen: Liar Liar [1997]"

"Liar Liar is a 1997 American comedy film written by Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, directed by Tom Shadyac and starring Jim Carrey. Carrey was nominated for a Golden Globe Award (1997) for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. The film is the second of three collaborations between Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac, the first being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and the third being Bruce Almighty. It is also the second of three collaborations between Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, the first being The Little Rascals and the third being Heartbreakers. It was shot entirely in California." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_Liar

An amusing premise (a lawyer who can't lie for an entire day) make for a film almost as made for Jim Carrey as The Mask was.

7.5/10
