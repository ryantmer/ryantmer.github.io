"Blah blah blah, cars, blah blah, crappy everything, blah blah." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_these_films

An annoying black guy, an annoying american guy, and I don't even remember who was annoying in the third one because all three meld together in my memory as one giant heap of terrible.

3/10 - one for each film.
