It is, in fact, possible to get from Pearson Airport in Mississauga to Waterloo for cheap. Take the 107 bus route (stops about a 5 minute walk from Arrivals) to Square One, then the GO Bus from Square One to Waterloo. Total cost: $15.55 - or $12.55 if you're lucky and get a nice bus driver that tells you not to bother paying when you walk in. Thank you, unnamed Mississauga Transit employee, you made my day :)
