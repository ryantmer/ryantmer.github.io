title: "Very Short Reviews Of Movies Other People Have Already Seen: 9 [2009]"

[Wikipedia is down at the moment, so I can't plagiarize a description from it]

Animated, but don't mistake this for a kid's movie. A new take on a post-apocalyptic world makes for a fun 90 minutes.

9/10 (Just because deus ex machina is used a wee bit too often, mostly courtesy of 7.)
