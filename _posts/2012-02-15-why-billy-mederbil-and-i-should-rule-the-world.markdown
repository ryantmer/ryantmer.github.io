Billy: "I see you drivin'
Round town with the girl I love
and I'm like: 'Haiku' "

me: I do not think that
You're a very good writer.
Also, that's not yours :P

Billy: Hence the quotation marks, twatface.
You used a haiku
To send me that last message
Just realized! Derp.

me: Your quotation marks
Were not to show quotation
Your grammer just sucks.

Billy: I'll have sex with your
Mother. Syllable. Syllable
Syllable. Fuckface.

me: You completely missed
My bad spelling mistake
Your spelling sucks too.

Also I should note
That it is five-seven-five
Lurn2Haiku, bitch

Billy: :(

me: Don't you frowny face
This is basic high school shit-
Important for life!

Billy: :(:(:(:(:(
:(:(:(:(:(:(:(
:(:(:(:(
Shit. five-seven-four

me: You are just the worst
Help me, I'm stuck in haiku!
This doesn't feel good...

Billy: C-C-C-COMBO
BREAKER HAHAHAHAHA
NEED MOAR SYLLABLES

me: I was going to
C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
But this was too good.

Billy: I'm bad at haikus.
Don't want become better
I fear I am, though.

me: Four six and a four
Don't make no fuckin' haiku
Count your syllables!

Billy: That was five,sev,five!
Are you counting from zero?
Computer science!

me: "Don't" == 1
"Want" == 1
"Become" == 2
"Better" == 2
1+1+2+2 = 6

Billy: I forgot to say
A single word, 'to'. Dammit!
That middle line is fail.

me: You are full of fail
So your haikus are as well
Which is no surprise...

Billy: Could you do me favor?
I need to test video
for conference sys.

Skype me in five min?
Would be appreciated.
Please and thank you, sir!

me: I am going home
In about 5 or 10, so
Can we wait a bit?

Billy: Yay! TYVM.
May many women touch you!
Or men, if you choose.

Billy: Ready for Skype yet?
Would you like to continue
To speak in haiku?

me: On my way home now
So give me about 10 minutes
Then I will be good.

Billy: Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight
Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight
Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight

Billy: This is not structured
As though it were a haiku.
Four syllables.
