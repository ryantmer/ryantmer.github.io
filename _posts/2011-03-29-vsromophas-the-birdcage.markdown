"A gay cabaret owner and his drag queen companion agree to put up a false straight front so that their son can introduce them to his fianc√©'s right-wing moralistic parents." http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115685/

This is a comedy film I actually enjoyed. Enough said.

P.S. Robin Williams is awesome as always.
