"Armageddon is a 1998 American disaster/science fiction-action film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and released on Disney's Touchstone Pictures label. The movie tells of a group of blue-collar deep-core drillers sent by NASA to stop an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. It featured an all-star cast including Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Peter Stormare, Michael Clarke Duncan and Steve Buscemi. It is now released on Blu-ray." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon_(1998_film)

It's a Michael Bay film. Explosions and clich√©s. What else do you want? A painfully long two and a half hours...

5/10 - because fancy explosions count for something, I guess...
