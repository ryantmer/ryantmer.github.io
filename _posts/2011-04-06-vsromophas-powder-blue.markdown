"Several Los Angeles residents meet on Christmas Eve through chance, tragedy, loss and divine intervention. Patrick Swayze plays the sleazy owner of the strip club where Jessica Biel's character dances. Biel's character, Rose-Johnny, is a dancer and mother. Her son is in a coma. Eddie Redmayne portrays a mortician who falls in love with her. Kris Kristofferson plays the head of a corporate crime organization who tries to convince his former employee (Ray Liotta) not to seek vengeance on his co-workers. Liotta's character also reveals to Rose-Johnny that he is her father. Forest Whitaker, who also serves as a producer on the film, is a suicidal ex-priest. Alejandro Romero plays a transvestite prostitute who shares an unexpected bond with the priest." -Â http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_Blue_(film)

An odd and overly sensual film that occasionally manages to achieve charm and emotion (mainly through excellent music), but mostly fails to tell a truly compelling story.
