I'm a University of Waterloo gradute with an honours computer engineering degree (2014). Before moving to Waterloo, I attended elementary/high school in Yellowknife, NT.

During my five-year co-op degree I did work terms at [Aeryon Labs Inc.](http://www.aeryon.com), [Teledyne DALSA Inc.](https://www.teledynedalsa.com/), [BlackBerry](http://ca.blackberry.com/), [NorthwesTel](http://www.nwtel.ca/), and [Agfa Healthcare](http://www.agfahealthcare.com/). Most of these positions were centred around software development, although I've dabbled in hardware over the years as well, more so at home than at work.

Most of my coding hours having been spent learning and using Python, Java, and MATLAB. A core focus of mine is internal tools, as I am primarily interested in development of software that makes developers' and testers' lives easier. I'm also a staunch believer in code cleanliness and readability ("Have you read [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)? You should read PEP8.") and always try to keep in mind that code is read more than it is written. I'm also familiar to varying degrees with many web technologies including HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AngularJS, and have some experience with LAMP-based sites.

In addition to writing code and soldering circuits, I also enjoy a plethora of other, unrelated things. Road and mountain biking, photography, camping and canoeing, speed skating, dodgeball, playing music, going to concerts, theatre, web development, and riding and repairing old motorcycles. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty, to speak up, and to admit that, yes, I like pop punk music.

If you have any questions about who I am, how I am, what I do, or what the advantages and disadvantages of shaft drive are compared to chain drive, please don't hesitate to contact me via [email](mailto:ryantmer@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryantmer). And hey... have an awesome day, because you're awesome.
