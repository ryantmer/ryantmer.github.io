I"â<p>â€œAnimal Crackers is a 1930 American comedy film, in which mayhem and zaniness ensue when a valuable painting goes missing during a party in honor of famed African explorer Captain Spaulding. The film was both a critical and commercial success upon initial release, and remains one of the Marx Brothersâ€™ most beloved and often-quoted movies. Filming was done at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens, and was the last film the brothers would make in New York.â€ - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crackers_(film)</p>

<p>â€œCaptain, this leaves me speechless!â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, see that you remain that way.â€</p>
