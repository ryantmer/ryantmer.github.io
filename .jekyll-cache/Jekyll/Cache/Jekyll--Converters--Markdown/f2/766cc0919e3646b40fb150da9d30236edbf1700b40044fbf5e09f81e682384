<p>If you liked Burn After Reading, youâ€™ll like this. However, if you donâ€™t want to wait 80 minutes for an ending scene that you may or may not find hilarious, this does not an entertaining film make.</p>

<p>6.66/10 - a slapstick comedy war film with only slapstick and war for the most part.</p>
