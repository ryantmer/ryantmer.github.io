I"æ<p>Sci-fi that â€œfollows a young soldier named Johnny Rico and his exploits in the Mobile Infantry, a futuristic military unit. Ricoâ€™s military career progresses from recruit to non-commissioned officer and finally to officer against the backdrop of an interstellar war between mankind and an arachnoid species known as â€œthe Bugsâ€.â€ - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers_(film</p>

<p>Special effects that make some newer films look amateur, this is a surprisingly funny (read: over-the-top and ridiculous) parody of militarism and totalitarianism. Lame storyline and acting, but hey, this is science fiction. Get used to it.</p>
