I"z<p>Sometimes, life doesn’t go the way you want it to.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you look outside, and all you see are gray skies.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you want time to skip a few days, or months, or years.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you want time to stop.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you have to climb walls built out of the bodies of your enemies.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you have to build walls out of the bodies of your friends.</p>

<p>Sometimes, your head longs strongest, but your heart longs longest.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you have to change direction in life.</p>

<p>Sometimes, all you do is turn back.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in longing for the mediocre, you turn away the best.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you have to make decisions that you’re afraid of.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you can’t help but think “what if?”, only to realize “what if” never would have happened anyway.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you look for love in all the places you know, but it turns out that you only know the wrong places.</p>

<p>But sometimes…</p>

<p>Sometimes, the road straightens out.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the skies clear and the sun rises on a new horizon.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you just have to enjoy the good moments, and remember the bad ones.</p>

<p>Sometimes, all barriers ahead of you crumble, leaving a clear path in their midst.</p>

<p>Sometimes, your heart and your head agree.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when you head back, you head home.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the hardest decisions make themselves, and the hardest question to answer is, “Shaken or stirred?”</p>

<p>Sometimes, the mediocre turns out to be best, and the best turns out to be less.</p>

<p>Sometimes, “what if?” isn’t nearly as good as what is.</p>

<p>Sometimes, love finds you - huddled up in the corner of a cold room inhabited by the lost and the lonely.</p>

<p>And sometimes, you get bored late at night and write some artsy shit on the internet that’s all deep and whatnot.</p>
