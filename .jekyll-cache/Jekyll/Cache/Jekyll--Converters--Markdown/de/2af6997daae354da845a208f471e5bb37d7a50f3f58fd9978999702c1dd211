I"ë<p>For no particular reason, I made a not-at-all accurate planet simulator in JavaScript, <a href="http://mahler.ca/stuff/planets/planets.html">here</a>, with the repo <a href="https://github.com/ryantmer/JSPlanets">here</a>. Because of its heavy reliance on CSS3 animation, some parts donâ€™t work on some browsers. In particular, changing the orbit period doesnâ€™t seem to work on Chrome 40 (although it does in Canary, Chrome 42).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s oddly serene to watch it fullscreen.</p>
