<p>“Idiocracy is a 2006 American satirical comedy film, directed by Mike Judge and starring Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard. The film tells the story of two ordinary people who are taken into a top-secret military hibernation experiment that goes awry, and awaken 500 years in the future. They discover that the world has degenerated into a dystopia where advertising, commercialism, and cultural anti-intellectualism run rampant and dysgenic pressure has resulted in a uniformly stupid human society devoid of individual responsibility or consequences.” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy</p>

<p>Amusingly, this film would fit right in in the idiotic future it portrays. Thoroughly un-amusing throughout.</p>

<p>0/10 - yes, it’s actually that bad.</p>
