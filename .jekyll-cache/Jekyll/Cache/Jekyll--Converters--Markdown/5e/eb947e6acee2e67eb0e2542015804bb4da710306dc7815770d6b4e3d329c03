I"à<p>â€œThe Mummy is a 1999 American historical adventure film written and directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Kevin J. Oâ€™Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the title role as the reanimated mummy. It is a loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name which starred Boris Karloff in the title role. Originally intended to be part of a low-budget horror series, the movie was eventually turned into a blockbuster adventure film with mild horror themes.â€ - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mummy_(1999_film)</p>

<p>As close to Indiana Jones as you can get if Harrison Ford bothers you on a deep, subconscious level.</p>

<p>8/10 - Solid, although not quite as good as Indyâ€™s flicks.</p>
