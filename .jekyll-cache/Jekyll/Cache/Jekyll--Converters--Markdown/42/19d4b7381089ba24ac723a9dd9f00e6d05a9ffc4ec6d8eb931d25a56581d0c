I"Á<p>â€œ(500) Days of Summer is a 2009 romantic-drama-comedy film. It was written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, directed by Marc Webb, produced by Mark Waters, and stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. The story is presented in a nonlinear narrative structure and depicts a memory-driven look at a failed romance.â€ - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(500)_Days_of_Summer</p>

<p>Not a movie that I would usually like, but I was somehow smiling the whole way through. Then again, that could just be Zooey Deschanel. One of those films that bills itself as â€œquirkyâ€, this is one of the few that does it relatively well. Not sure that the comedy tag fits this film - although amusing, Iâ€™m not sure that I ever actually laughed. Well, except at the impromptu musical number.</p>

<p>8.5/10 - would be 7.5, but Zooey Deschanelâ€™s cuteness gives an extra point.</p>
