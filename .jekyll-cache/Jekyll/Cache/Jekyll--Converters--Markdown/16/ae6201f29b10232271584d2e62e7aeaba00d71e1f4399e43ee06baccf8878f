I"¶<p>Billy: â€œI see you drivinâ€™
Round town with the girl I love
and Iâ€™m like: â€˜Haikuâ€™ â€œ</p>

<p>me: I do not think that
Youâ€™re a very good writer.
Also, thatâ€™s not yours :P</p>

<p>Billy: Hence the quotation marks, twatface.
You used a haiku
To send me that last message
Just realized! Derp.</p>

<p>me: Your quotation marks
Were not to show quotation
Your grammer just sucks.</p>

<p>Billy: Iâ€™ll have sex with your
Mother. Syllable. Syllable
Syllable. Fuckface.</p>

<p>me: You completely missed
My bad spelling mistake
Your spelling sucks too.</p>

<p>Also I should note
That it is five-seven-five
Lurn2Haiku, bitch</p>

<p>Billy: :(</p>

<p>me: Donâ€™t you frowny face
This is basic high school shit-
Important for life!</p>

<p>Billy: :(:(:(:(:(
:(:(:(:(:(:(:(
:(:(:(:(
Shit. five-seven-four</p>

<p>me: You are just the worst
Help me, Iâ€™m stuck in haiku!
This doesnâ€™t feel goodâ€¦</p>

<p>Billy: C-C-C-COMBO
BREAKER HAHAHAHAHA
NEED MOAR SYLLABLES</p>

<p>me: I was going to
C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER
But this was too good.</p>

<p>Billy: Iâ€™m bad at haikus.
Donâ€™t want become better
I fear I am, though.</p>

<p>me: Four six and a four
Donâ€™t make no fuckinâ€™ haiku
Count your syllables!</p>

<p>Billy: That was five,sev,five!
Are you counting from zero?
Computer science!</p>

<p>me: â€œDonâ€™tâ€ == 1
â€œWantâ€ == 1
â€œBecomeâ€ == 2
â€œBetterâ€ == 2
1+1+2+2 = 6</p>

<p>Billy: I forgot to say
A single word, â€˜toâ€™. Dammit!
That middle line is fail.</p>

<p>me: You are full of fail
So your haikus are as well
Which is no surpriseâ€¦</p>

<p>Billy: Could you do me favor?
I need to test video
for conference sys.</p>

<p>Skype me in five min?
Would be appreciated.
Please and thank you, sir!</p>

<p>me: I am going home
In about 5 or 10, so
Can we wait a bit?</p>

<p>Billy: Yay! TYVM.
May many women touch you!
Or men, if you choose.</p>

<p>Billy: Ready for Skype yet?
Would you like to continue
To speak in haiku?</p>

<p>me: On my way home now
So give me about 10 minutes
Then I will be good.</p>

<p>Billy: Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight
Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight
Aight Aight Aight Aight Aight</p>

<p>Billy: This is not structured
As though it were a haiku.
Four syllables.</p>
