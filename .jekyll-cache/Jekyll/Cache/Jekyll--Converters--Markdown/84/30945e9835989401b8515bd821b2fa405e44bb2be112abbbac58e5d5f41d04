I"+<p>“The Lorax is a 2012 American computer-animated 3D musical comedy film based on Dr. Seuss’ children’s book of the same name. It was produced by Illumination Entertainment and was released by Universal Pictures on March 2, 2012, the 108th anniversary of Seuss’ birth.” - http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lorax_(film)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this film fails to portray the environmental message behind Seuss’ work, and instead focuses on slapstick humour and dangerous driving.</p>

<p>2/10 (-1 for bringing shame to an excellent story)</p>
