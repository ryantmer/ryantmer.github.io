I"z<p>“A gay cabaret owner and his drag queen companion agree to put up a false straight front so that their son can introduce them to his fiancé’s right-wing moralistic parents.” http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115685/</p>

<p>This is a comedy film I actually enjoyed. Enough said.</p>

<p>P.S. Robin Williams is awesome as always.</p>
