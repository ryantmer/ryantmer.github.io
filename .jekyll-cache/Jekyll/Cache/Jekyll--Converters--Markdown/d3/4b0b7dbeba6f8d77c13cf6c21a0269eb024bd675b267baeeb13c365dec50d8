<p>I hate to be clich√©d, but this is the only film I have ever seen that I can describe as ‚Äúgripping drama‚Äù. Damned good, with a hint of oak aftertaste.</p>

<p>8.5262/10 - Tilda Swindon‚Äôs fake american accent is annoying at times, and the overload of legal and business terms can be somewhat detrimental to the flow of the story in parts.</p>
