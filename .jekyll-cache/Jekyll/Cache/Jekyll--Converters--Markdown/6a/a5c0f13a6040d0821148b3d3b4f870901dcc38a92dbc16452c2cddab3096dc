I"–<p>‚ÄúRequiem for a Dream is a 2000 film adaptation of the 1978 novel of the same name. [‚Ä¶] The film depicts different forms of addiction, leading to the characters‚Äô imprisonment in a dream world of delusion and reckless desperation that is subsequently overtaken and devastated by reality.‚Äù ‚Äì http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_for_a_Dream</p>

<p>A shocking and powerful yet somewhat dramatized look into drug addiction from four distinct points of view. Certainly not a happy movie, this would do a better job of preventing drug use than most other methods, I would imagine‚Ä¶</p>

<p>8/10, for making me feel all unhappy inside.</p>
