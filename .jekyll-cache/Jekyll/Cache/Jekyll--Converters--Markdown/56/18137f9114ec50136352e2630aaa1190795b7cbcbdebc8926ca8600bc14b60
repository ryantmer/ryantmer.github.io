I"[<p>“This film stars Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Anthony Edwards, Val Kilmer, Meg Ryan, and Tom Skerritt. Cruise plays Lieutenant Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, a young Naval aviator on board the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. He and his Naval Flight Officer (Radar Intercept Officer - the “RIO” - the “back seater” in the two-man F-14 Tomcat) Lt. j.g. Nick “Goose” Bradshaw are given the chance to train at the Navy’s Fighter Weapons School, after the pilot above him in the squadron rankings resigns from duty following a very stressful mission. This film depicts Maverick’s progress through the training, his romance with a female instructor, and his overcoming a crisis of confidence following a fatal training accident.” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_gun</p>

<p>No idea why this film was so popular. Maybe it’s just the 80s hairstyles, but sitting through the entire length of this film was actually quite excruciating. Not sure if it’s action, romance, or just a blatant US Navy recruiting project.</p>
