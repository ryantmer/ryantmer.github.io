I"Ä<p>â€œThe Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The film stars Tim Robbins as Andrew â€œAndyâ€ Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd â€œRedâ€ Redding. The film portrays Andy, who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison, a fictional penitentiary in Maine, and his friendship with Red, a fellow inmate. Despite a lukewarm box office reception that was barely enough to cover its budget, the film received favorable reviews from critics, multiple award nominations, and has since enjoyed a remarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. This revival is reflected in its high placement on various lists of great movies.â€ - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption</p>

<p>A new entrant in my personal top 10. Intrigue, drama, humour, and one twisted bastard. Redemption is a dish best served by Morgan Freeman.</p>

<p>9/10 - because the non-word â€œfunnerâ€ is used once, and the fact that Andyâ€™s hair somehow stays the same for 10 years in prison bothered meâ€¦</p>
