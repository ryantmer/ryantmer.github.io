I"*<p>“The Breakfast Club is a 1985 American coming of age comedy-drama film written and directed by John Hughes and starring Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy. The storyline follows five teenagers (each a member of a different high school clique) as they spend a Saturday in detention together and come to realize that they are all deeper than their respective stereotypes” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Club</p>

<p>Despite my dislike of all things ’80s, and all things coming-of-age-angsty-teenager-related (including angsty teenagers who are coming of age), I managed to actually enjoy this. A lot, in fact.</p>

<p>8.99/10, and you get +20 to “Ability to understand pop culture references”, assuming you’re in that skill tree.</p>
