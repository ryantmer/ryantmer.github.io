The story follows a robot named WALL-E, who is designed to clean up a waste-covered Earth far in the future. He falls in love with another robot named EVE, who also has a programmed task, and follows her into outer space on an adventure that changes the destiny of both his kind and humanity. Both robots exhibit an appearance of free will and emotions similar to humans, which develop further as the film progresses.” - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall-e</p>

<p>WALL•E manages to say more in the first 40 minutes of R2-D2-speak than most films can in 90 minutes with endless dialogue.</p>
