I"á<p>‚ÄúThe Bourne films are a series of assassin films based on the character Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia, created by author Robert Ludlum. All three of Ludlum‚Äôs novels were adapted for the screen, featuring Matt Damon as the titular character in each. Doug Liman directed The Bourne Identity (2002), Paul Greengrass directed The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), and Tony Gilroy co-wrote each film. The series is noted for its realism, in contrast to the growing use of CGI in the action genre.‚Äù - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_(film_series)</p>

<p>What can only be described as the world‚Äôs longest chase scene does manage to remain thrilling and action-packed throughout all three films, but it is nonetheless three films which probably would have been just as good packed into one film‚Ä¶</p>
