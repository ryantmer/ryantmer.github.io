I"¹<p>Wellâ€¦ this is awkward. Iâ€™m writing a post about setting and keeping goals, and despite my own list of goals and todos always including â€œwrite moreâ€, this is the first thing Iâ€™ve posted in (checks notes) three years. Ahem - do as I say, not as I do.</p>

<p>Recent events have meant that people are spending a fair amount of time inside. For some this is harder than others, but I can boastfully say the transition has been quite easy for me. Obviously, as a person who already worked remotely, from home, for a company based three hours ahead, I had a big head start. That transition definitely <em>wasnâ€™t</em> easy, in fact, and took months for me to get it right. But this post isnâ€™t about working from home - itâ€™s about not-working from home.</p>

<h2 id="smart-goals">SMART Goals</h2>

<p>Okay, weâ€™re going to talk about SMART goals. SMART is, unfortunately, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">an acronym</a>. Iâ€™m not a big fan of these sort of business-speak, feel-good, personal-development-y things, but this one Iâ€™ve made an exception for. Simply put, SMART goals are:</p>

<p>Specific
Measurable
Attainable
Relevant
Timely</p>

<p>Specific. Specific goals are, well, specific. â€œLearn moreâ€ is a shitty goal, because that doesnâ€™t really <em>mean</em> anything. A specific goal would be â€œlearn about the Halifax explosion of 1917â€, or â€œlearn to play the guitarâ€. The more specific a goal is, the easier it is to apply the rest of the SMART criteria.</p>

<p>Measurable. Measurable goals are, well, measurable. (Thereâ€™s a theme to this acronym.) â€œLearn to play the guitarâ€ is a shitty goal, because when have you learned to play the guitar? When you can play a G chord? Or when you can play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhMfz4HrcEA">Bloodmeat</a> flawlessly? By adding some sort of metric to a goal, you can set a measurable goal on it. Perhaps you want to reach 80% accuracy on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VQ_3sBZEm0">Learn to Fly</a> in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/205190/Rocksmith/">Rocksmith</a>. (This post is not sponsored. But it could be.)? Or perhaps you want to memorize 20 chords? Making goals measurable is really what allows you say â€œIâ€™ve accomplished the goalâ€. Without it, youâ€™re trying to score on your own moving goalposts.</p>

<p>Attaintable. Attainable goals are, well, attainable. â€œLearn to play Bloodmeat on guitar flawlesslyâ€ is a shitty goal, because letâ€™s be honest - if youâ€™re just picking up the guitar for fun, is that really going to happen? A technical song written and performed by professional guitarists is unlikely to be playable by an average person wanting to learn guitar. What is attainable and what isnâ€™t is very subjective, and will largely depend on just how far into any particular goal you want to go. If you want to play some guitar chords while sitting at the campfire, learning to play a handful of chords by memory is a much more attainable goal, and makes a lot more sense.</p>

<p>Relevant. Relevant goals are, well, relevant. â€œLearn to play some guitar chords to play while sitting at the campfireâ€ is a shitty goal, because what if you donâ€™t like camping? What if you canâ€™t stand the sound of an acoustic guitar? What if you donâ€™t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a guitar? If these questions are making you reconsider, itâ€™s possible that this isnâ€™t a very relevant goal to you. Instead, perhaps youâ€™re really into woodwind instruments, and perhaps you only want to invest a few dollars. Maybe you should learn the recorder instead.</p>

<p>Timely. Timely goals are (say it with me now), well, timely. â€œLearn to play some basic recorder chords so that I can annoy my friends at the campfireâ€ is a shitty goal, because when are you going to whip that bad boy out? Next week? By 2050? Sometime before you die? Without at least some time pressure, itâ€™s entirely possible youâ€™ll never make the time to start working towards the goal. You donâ€™t need to be strict here, but even an approximate timeframe can be good.</p>

<p>â€œLearn to play some basic recorder notes so that I can annoy my friends at the campfire by our next camping trip this coming Septemberâ€ - now thatâ€™s a SMART goal right there!</p>

<p>Drawing from my own experience, I set a SMART goal for myself back in the fall of 2019: run a 5k (specific) at under 5:00/km (measurable) - an improvement over my previous of ~6:00/km (attainable) - in order to improve my fitness (relevant) by the end of the year (timely). And guess what? â€¦I didnâ€™t make it. I still havenâ€™t, in fact. But thatâ€™s okay, and leads me ever-so-nicely to the next subjectâ€¦</p>

<h3 id="wimbley-wombley-timey-wimey-stuff">Wimbley-Wombley, Timey-Wimey Stuff</h3>

<p>Time is just like, a construct, man. Itâ€™s all in your mind. This is something Iâ€™ve found is important to remember when setting goals. I wanted to run 5:00/km by the end of 2019 and I didnâ€™t hit that target, butâ€¦ so what? Really, the â€œtimelyâ€ part of setting goals is more about having an approximate expiration date on it. Goals are like canned soup - the expiration date is more of a suggestion anyway. (Legal disclaimer: I just ate soup that was two years out of date and Iâ€™m fine, so you probably should too.) If you donâ€™t make it, thatâ€™s okay! Just set a new timely goal, and work towards that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, donâ€™t be too loose with your time constraints. I think this is one reason why new yearâ€™s resolutions so often fail - because doing something â€œthis yearâ€ is just reallyâ€¦ nebulous. Smaller, shorter-term goals are going to be easier to track and stick to than larger, longer-term ones. â€œRun a &lt;5:00/km 5kâ€ is something I can set my sights on in a few weeks or months - â€œrun a marathonâ€ is a significantly larger timescale, and I donâ€™t really have any checkpoints along the way to know how Iâ€™m doing. Think of this as thin-slicing your work - by having smaller, shorter-term goals, you can constantly be checking up and checking in on whatâ€™s working, what isnâ€™t, what needs to be adjusted, etc.</p>

<p>In summary, set time limits. Then ignore them.</p>

<h3 id="write-shit-down">Write Shit Down</h3>

<p>Being able to track goals is also pretty important. Without going into the boring detailed analysis of all the various goal-tracking, to-do organizing, schedule-optimizing apps and services that Iâ€™ve tried, I will simply jump to the conclusion: I use Evernote for larger, broader-scope planning, and Google Keep for quickly jotting down smaller things. Evernote is used to write down the full SMART of the â€œ&lt;5:00/km 5kâ€, Google Keep is â€œGo for a run; Due: todayâ€. YMMV, but Iâ€™ve found having a quick-and-dirty app for every day stuff alongside a more journal-esque app to be what works for me.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Okay, this the last part of this rambling, I promise. Motivation is a tricky, sticky subject. Some people seem to think that their inability to get things done is just because they canâ€™t motivate themselves. Well, theyâ€™re probably right. Any SMART-goal-setting, time-limit-bending, perfect-app-using go-getter is going to get exactly shit all done without motivation. My humble (but loudly yelled) opinion is motivation is a highly personal affair, so itâ€™s likely that reading a million blog posts about a million ways to get motivated still wonâ€™t get your ass out of the chair. Find what works for you - I used to be fairly unmotivated/lazy, but by being extremely organized and following some rigid structures, I was able to build my ability to self-motivate, and find that for me, bettering myself on a daily basis is what I find motivating.</p>

<p>And if all else fails, some wise words: you may not want to exercise, but you do <em>want to have had exercised</em>?
